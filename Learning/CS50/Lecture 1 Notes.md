```c
if (x < y)
{
	printf("x is less than y\n");
}
else if (x > y)
{
	printf("x is greater than y\n");
}
else
{
	printf("x is equal to y\n");
}
```

```c
char c = get char("Do you agree? ")
	if (c = 'y' || c = 'Y')
	{
		printf("Agreed."\n);
	}
	if (c = 'n' || c = "N")
	{
		printf("Disagreed."\n);
	}
```

## Operations
```c
int counter = 0 
// set counter to 0
```
```c
counter = counter + 1 
counter += 1; 
counter++;
// increase counter by 1 (right to left)
```
```c 
counter--; 
// decrease counter by 1
```

## Loops
```c
int counter = 3;
while (counter > 0)
{
	printf("meow\n");
	counter = counter - 1;
}
// say meow 3 times
