Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis

Babies pyloris grows in size and narrows the opening between stomach and duodenum
S/S
- visible peristalsis
- projectile vomiting
- olive sized mass in RUQ
FAILURE TO THRIVE

Diagnosed by x-ray or ultrasound and labs

Pyloric antrum and pyloric canal (connects duodenum) -- Pyloric sphincter lets food pass down only

HPS - born with normal pylorus and few weeks after birth smooth muscle goes through hypertrophy
pyloric antrum doubles in size

enlarged pylorus felt as olive in RUQ
HPS can cause peristalsis to be much more difficult and then hypertrophy of the stomach --> visible stomach peristalsis

projectile vomit doesn't contain bile  -- > dehydration --> retain sodium --> hypokalemia --> METABOLIC ALKALOSIS
--> loss of hydrochloric acid --> depletes chloride --> hypochloremia

cause: unknown
* genetic (infant boys and first born children)
* exposure to macrolide antibiotics

Treatment
- dehydration
- electrolyte correction
- surgery
- high fowlers/upright feeding
- thickened fluids (remain in stomach)


Pyloromyotomy
- general anesthesia
- breathing tube inserted through nose or mouth

3 tiny incisions near the belly button
insert camera/surgical instruments

incision made on outside of pyloric sphincter/ leave inner tissue lining intact
widen the incision and spread the muscle fibers apart -- loosens the muscle

after:
- recovery room for monitoring
- pain medications
- feedings begin shortly after operation
- discharged within 1-2 days once fluid and nutrition needs are met

Monitor POST OP
- pain and analgesia
    - nociception: neonatal pain perception
    changes in facial activity and heart rate remain the most sensitive markers of nociception in the neonate
    acetaminophen is the most widely used antipyretic and mild analgesic
    morphine and codeine with respiratory monitoring
- temperature
    - increased oxygen consumption
    impaired respiratory responses
    decreased drug metabolism (with lower temperatures)
    depressed immune function
    poor platelet function
    reduced ability of wound repair
- respiratory evaluation
    - apnea related to anesthesia
    cessation of breathing for 15 to 20 seconds
    bradycardia, cyanosis or pallor
    pulmonary ventilation is immature in preterm infants
- fluids and electrolytes
    - pre and post op requirements: maintenance, ongoing losses, fluid compartment shifts
    serum chloride, potassium, plasma osmolarity, urine electrolytes, specific gravity and blood gas analysis
    insensible water losses, urine and stool water (evaporation of water through skin 66% and respiratory tract)
- nutrition
    - return of digestion monitoring urine sand stool output (monitor for blood in urine and stool; labs)
    restriction of peripheral fluid intake may be necessary to avoid volume overload
    reintroduce oral feeding
- wound evaluation
    - skin fragility and increased risk of epidermal stripping
    increased percutaneous absorption of topical agents due to increased body surface area to weight
    may contaminate wound and dressings
    hospital acquired skin injury, diaper dermatitis/irritant associated dermatitis
    optimal product choice for local wound care based on depth of injury and amount of exudate (zinc based and silver based that aren't good for babies)
        make sure its verified first :0
