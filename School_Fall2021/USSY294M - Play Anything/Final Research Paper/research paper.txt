I have changed my topic to the psychology of horror games and why we, as humans, love horror games even though it gives us so much fear and anxiety. I am going to be discussing the fight-or-flight response and the physiological processes behind them. I will also be discussing the many types of horror games and their mechanisms, gameplay, elements etc. I want to also dive deeper into psychological horror games in particular, and will bring up some titles and analyze them in order to support what I am trying to discuss. 
To get more specific into psychology and biology, I found an interesting thing that could also hold a chunk of my writing: the brain area most associated with recognizing fear is the amygdala, but the hippocampus is more active when engaging in horror. And this is interesting because the hippocampus is involved in memory recollection, which bring up some interesting questions about the incorporation of players' psyches and memories into playing horror games and its effect.
