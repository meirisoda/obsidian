**Lifestyle Medicine -** a medical approach that uses evidence-based behavioral interventions to prevent, treat and manage chronic disease

**Functional Medicine -** Looks to the root cause of disease, complements conventional medicine, views the body as one whole system

### **Lifestyle and Environmental Factors**
- Sleep & Relaxation
- Exercise & Movement
- Nutrition
- Stress
- Relationships 

**Nutrition -** the science that links foods to health and disease. Includes digestion, absorption, transportation and excretion of food substances and waste products. 

Important terms to know: 
- Disease
- Chronic
- Acute
- Risk factor
- Symptom
- Lifestyle (refer to lifestyle and environmental factors) 

### Factors Affecting Food Choices
1. Restaurant food is often calorie dense and have large portions, also have poorer nutritional quality compared to foods made at home.
2. Time and convenience have become significant influences affecting food choices and stem from a lifestyle that limits the amount of time spent in food preparation. 
3. Economics play a role in our food choices. 
4. Nutrition directs people’s food purchases. People who tend to make health-related food choices are health-oriented and have active lifestyles too. 
5. Advertising is a major media tool for capturing the food interest of the consumer. 

### Why Do We Eat?
1. **Hunger** - primarily a physiological (internal) drive to find and eat food, mostly regulated by internal cues to eating. 
2. **Appetite** - primarily a psychological (external) influence that encourages to find and eat food, often in the absence of obvious hunger. 
3. **Satiety** - state in which there is no longer a desire to eat; a feeling of satisfaction 

### Calories
**Little C :** The amount of heat it takes to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius
**Capital C:** the way energy is represented in food (kcal aka 1000c) 
### Nutrients

1. Growth, development and maintenance
2. Regulate body processes 

**Macronutrients** - provide calories (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, )
**Micronutrients** - do not provide calories


Fat soluble ~ ADEK (dairy, nuts, seeds, oils) 
Water soluble ~B and C (fruits and vegetables) 
- destroyed during cooking
- Fats/Lipids: energy yielding (9kcl/g)
- includes fats and oils 
- from both plant and animal sources
- not water soluble  | Minerals: Inorganic 
- serves different functions such as nervous system functioning, water balance and musculoskeletal processes
- not destroyed during cooking  |
| Proteins: energy yielding (~4kcl/g) 
- Main structural material in the body (bone & muscle) 
- forms when amino acids bond together 
- consumed in excess in the US | Water: acts as solvent and lubricant
- transports nutrients and waste
- medium for temperature regulation
- majority of our body weight |

### Nutrition Terms

**Nutritional State:** Nutritional health determined by ABCDE 

- Anthropometric measurements - body weight, lengths, circumferences etc.
- Biochemical measurements of nutrients - biochemical functions related to a nutrient’s function
- Clinical examination - general appearance of skin, eyes, and tongue; evidence of rapid hair loss; sense of touch; ability to cough, walk etc.
- Dietary analysis - estimation of typical food choices relying on the recounting of one’s usual intake or record of previous days’ intake
- Economic evaluation - living conditions, education level, ability to purchase, transport and cook food

**Malnutrition:** Failing health from long-standing dietary practices that do not coincide with nutritional needs - can refer to overnutrition or undernutrition **

**Functional foods** provide health benefits beyond those supplied by the traditional nutrients they contain 

**Energy Density** is determined by comparing the calorie (kcal) content with the weight of food 

**Dietary Guidelines for Americans** provide science based advice on what to eat and drink to promote health, help reduce risk of chronic disease and meet nutrient needs. 

1. Follow a healthy dietary pattern at every life stage
2. Customize and enjoy nutrient-dense food and beverage choices to reflect personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations
3. Focus on meeting food group needs with nutrient dense foods and beverages and stay within calorie limits 
4. limit foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat and sodium, and limit alcoholic beverages. 

**Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans** 

Health benefits occur with at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity in adults and 60 minutes per day for children and adolescents. 

**Benefits**

- control weight
- reduce your risk of CVD, T2DM, metabolic syndrome and some cancers
- improve mental health and mood
- strengthen your bones and muscles

***Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)*** is a term used to encompass nutrient recommendations by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine 
- Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) 
- Adequate Intakes (AI) 
- Estimated Energy Requirements (EER) : estimates kcal intake needed to match the energy use of an average person in a specific life stage
- Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (Upper Levels or UL) 
- Daily Value (DV) : nutrient standard used on the nutrition facts portion of the food label (based off a 2000kcal diet) 

### Health Claims

- Health Claims (regulated by the FDA) 
- Preliminary health claims (regulated by the FDA) 
- Nutrient claims (regulated by the FDA) 
- Structure/function claims (not regulated by the FDA) 

### Terms
