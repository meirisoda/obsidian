# Quiz 2 Discussion Board Questions

**The nurse is assisting the surgeon with prepping the patient for a tib-fib open reduction. The surgeon begins to use ChloraPrep to cleanse the area that the surgery is about to be performed. The surgeon then holds that leg up for 3 minutes and does not let anyone else touch the leg. The Nurse ask you why the surgeon did not let anyone touch the leg for 3 minutes after the application of ChoraPrep.**

A) reduces fire hazard

B) reduces pooling of the CholraPrep

C) 3 minutes allows for the reduction of bacterial load on the skin

D) all of the above

Correct Answer: D

Rationale:  Waiting 3 minutes for an alcohol-based prep to dry before you drape not only helps prevent surgical fires, especially during electrosurgical cases. Pooling of ChloraPrep creates an opportunity for surgical fires throughout the procedure.  Equally important is that it is the amount of time that is required to reduce the bacterial load on the skin.

**The nursing student is asking his/her preceptor what is the role of scrub/circulating nurses when dealing with tissue specimens collected or medications used during the surgery. What is the best description of their actions?**

a. The sample is labeled by the scrub nurse and is sent to the lab by the circulating nurse. Medications and solutions are transferred to the sterile table by the circulating nurse while the name, strength, dosage, and expiration date is labelled by the scrub nurse.

b. Both the tissue specimens and medications are handled by the circulating nurse only.

c. Both the tissue specimens and medications are handled by the scrub nurse only.

d. It is not either the scrub/circulating nurses' responsibly, it is the surgeons job.

Answer: A

Rationale: The circulating nurse works in collaboration with the surgical team to provide the best course of action for each patient. As a leader, the circulating nurse manages the OR and protects the patient's safety during the procedure, the surgical team coordinating under the supervision of the circulating nurse. As part of the circulating nurse's responsbiliblky, they must ensure verification, appropriate lighting/equipment/humidity/temperature, and implementing the Surgical Safety Checklist (SSC). It is imperative that all roles of the OR are responsible and aware of what is expected from each member; thus, option A is the correct answer as it lays out the responsibilities and designated outcomes required from both the scrub and circulating nurse in the OR setting.

**A nurse is assisting in the operating room during surgery and is responsible for intraoperative specimen collection. Which action by the nurse reflects the correct procedure for handling specimens collected during surgery?**

A) Labeling the specimen container with the patient's name and date of birth after collection.
B) Keeping the specimen container open on the sterile field for easy access during the procedure.
C) Placing the specimen container on a nearby table so the circulating nurse can label it later.
D) Immediately transporting the specimen to the pathology laboratory as soon as it is collected.

Correct Answer: A

Rationale:
Option A is the correct choice because proper labeling of the specimen container with the patient's name and date of birth is essential for accurate identification and documentation. This helps prevent any mix-ups. Option B is incorrect because keeping the specimen container open on the sterile field can lead to contamination. Option C is incorrect because an unlabeled specimen container on a nearby table can be easily misidentified and mishandling. Option D is also incorrect because not all specimens require immediate transport to the pathology lab.

**Patient safety is always a priority in healthcare. The Universal protocol is one of the tools used in the OR to implement clear goals for patient safety. The Universal protocol consists of ______?**

A. requiring all operating rooms to submit a detailed report of any safety infractions to the Joint Commission

B. Everyone in the surgical team pausing before incision to practice mediation and mindfulness for 1 minute

C. A surgical timeout where patient verification, procedure, and site is confirmed once again before procedure is started

D. A surgical timeout where everyone confirms the that the surgical items are sterile

Answer: C

Rationale: The Universal Protocol is supported by the Joint Commission who says to prevent common intraoperative mistakes like wrong site, wrong procedure, and wrong surgery from occurring, each surgery must consist of a timeout where everyone on the surgical team pauses to verify patient identity, site, and procedure.

**When a patient goes into the OR, what are some risk factors related to positioning injuries? (Select all that apply)**

```
Duration of surgery
Egg crate foam
Body position
Co-morbidities (ex] DM)
SCDs
All of them

```

Answers: 1, 3, 4, 6

Rationale: Duration of surgery influences the amount of time a person will be lying on the OR bed. The longer a patient is on the bed, the higher the risk is for developing pressure injuries. Egg crate foam is used as a cushion to protect the patient from developing any injuries on the lower extremities. Depending on the body position, some may result in more pressure injury points (like the lateral and prone positions). Diabetic patients have a higher risk of developing pressure injuries, especially if they have neuropathy that causes numbness in the feet. SCDs are a protective tool against blood clots.

**Which of the following would be a reason for talking to the surgeon about switching from Betadine 5% sterile ophthalmic solution to another surgical prep?**

1. There is only enough Betadine in the bottle for one use
2. The surgical site is located on the eyelid
3. The eye will need to be flushed with a sterile solution after use
4. The patient has an iodine allergy

Answer: 4

Rationale: Answers 1 and 2 are not correct because the Betadine bottle is intended to be single use in the periocular region externally or on the occupation surface of the eye. Answer 3 is incorrect because to use Betadine correctly the eye does not need to be flushed and if this is the best solution for the patient it is not worth switching solutions to avoid flushing the eye. Answer 4 is correct because Betadine includes iodine and should be switched to avoid a patient reaction to the solution.

**What does POLST stand for and who is it for?**

1. Portable oxygen life support treatment; for old people.
2. Physician's orders for life-sustaining treatment; for people with a serious illness.
3. Portable oxygen life support treatment; for people with a serious illness.
4. Physician's orders for life-sustaining treatment; for old people.

answer: 2

POLST stands for physician's order for life-sustaining treatment. They are medical forms that tell medical professionals what to do in the case of an emergency, specifically when you can't speak for yourself. A POLST always stays with you and it includes information that those you are trying to help would need; what treatments not to use, what treatments can be used, how long treatments should be used for, and when to withdraw them. Issues covered may include resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, tube feedings, information about antibiotics, and requests not to be transferred to a hospital or emergency department. Although old people may have a POLST, the primary reason for having one is if you suffer from a serious illness, therefore answer 4 is incorrect.

**A circulating nurse helps a case in the OR run properly. Which of the following responsibilities would NOT belong to the circulating nurse? (select all that apply)**

a. documenting when the patient enters the OR

b. verifying implants

c. handing instruments to the surgeon

d. assisting surgical team with positioning

e. narrating the events of the surgery

Correct Answers: C and E

Explanation:

A circulating nurse would not be responsible for handing the surgeon instruments. This role would be completed by the scrub tech or scrub nurse. A circulating nurse is not responsible for narrating the events of the surgery, and doing so would annoy many individuals. The circulating nurse should document the events of the surgery including start time and medications administered.

The circulating nurse IS responsible for documenting when the patient enters the OR. The circulating nurse should verify implants if they are being used. The circulating nurse should also ensure the patient is safe on the table and help with patient positioning.

**The OR nurse is reviewing a patient's DNR in their chart before surgery and is reviewing a pre-op checklist for live saving measures. Before the patient heads into surgery, the nurse checks with the patient, surgeon, and anesthesia team so that everyone understands the terms to the patient's DNR. What items should the nurse be checking for in the patient's DNR to understand their life saving measures? SELECT ALL THAT APPLY.**

A. intubation

B. timeline for extubation

C. compressions

D. medications (vasopressers, atropine, blood transfusion)

E. the family's opinion of the DNR

Answer: A,B,C,D

Rationale: A patient's DNR chart should include measures for intubation, extubation, compressions and CPR, and medications that can be given. Although the family can be involved with advocating for the patient in terms of a DNR and helping the medical team understand, their opinion is not included in the DNR, as it is what the patient wants for themselves.

**The surgeon removes a specimen from their patient during surgery and it's placed in a container to be sent to the lab. Choose the answer that is an unnecessary label of the specimen defined by the surgeon?**

1. Suspected diagnosis
2. SSN
3. Type of test ordered
4. Type of tissue

Answer: 2

Rationale: Specimen must be clearly defined by the surgeon and specific location stated. Other labeling that is crucial to be specified includes date and time of collection, type of tissue, suspected diagnosis, type of test, and preservation type (formalin (permanent or fixed), fresh, or frozen). The SSN of the patient is unnecessary because their name, DOB, and patient ID number/code are how we identify the patient and any specimen removed.

**Your patient just rolled back to the OR for a gastrointestinal surgery. The surgeon has requested Trendelenburg position to allow for better visualization and reduced blood loss.  As you begin to position the patient, what safety considerations should be on your mind regarding this position? Select all that apply.**

```
The patient may slide and will need to be secured appropriately.
The patient should be in this position for the entire procedure.
The patient could experience neurological complications.
The patient is at increased risk for skin breakdown.
The patient is at reduced risk for airway complications, so no attention is necessary.

```

Answers:  A, C, D

Rationale: Answer A is correct as the patient is elevated at a steep angle which places them against gravity. This can result in sliding and the patient should be properly secured using specially designed positioning devices. Answer B is incorrect as the patient should be in Trendelenburg position for as little time as possible. Prolonged periods in Trendelenburg position increase cephalic and intracranial pressure, leading to various neurological complications. For similar reasons, Answer C is correct. The nurse should be mindful of how long the patient has been in Trendelenburg and should target 3 hours or fewer.  Answer D is correct because the steep angle can cause sliding and skin shear. Because of this, the patient be appropriately secured and padded. Answer E is incorrect. When in Trendelenburg, gravity compresses the airway and reduces the expansion of the lung. The nurse and anesthesia team should ensure the patient is adequately perfused and advocated for positioning breaks when appropriate.

**Why is there a 3 minute dry time once chloroprep is applied to the patient's skin? Select all that apply.**

A. It gives the surgical team a quick break to relax and get coffee

B.  reduces the risk of surgical fires

C. reduces the amount of bacteria on the skin

D. the dry time does not matter

E. the nurse can catch up on their charting

Correct answer: B, C

Rationale: B is a correct answer because the chloraprep solution is alcohol based, which means the solution is flammable, so it is important to wait the entire dry time to reduce the risk of a surgical fire. C is also a correct answer because the 3 minutes dry time will help efficiently disinfect and reduce the amount of bacteria on the skin prior to applying the solution to help decrease the risk for infection (Glandorf, 2022). A is incorrect because the surgical team should not leave the operating room. D is incorrect because drying time does matter. E is incorrect because although during this time the nurse can catch up on their charting, this is not the reason why the dry time is 3 minutes.

Throughout the surgical procedure, the nursing responsibility is providing and ensuring the safety of the patient. While the patient was discussing her concerns with the nurses prior to surgery, she expresses the fear of not knowing what will happen to her while she is unconscious. What is the best response when explaining the plan of care that will be given while the patient is unconscious?

Throughout the surgical procedure, the nursing responsibility is providing and ensuring the safety of the patient. While the patient was discussing her concerns with the nurses prior to surgery, she expresses the fear of not knowing what will happen to her while she is unconscious. What is the best response when explaining the plan of care that will be given while the patient is unconscious?

1. "I will be right there with you, you're fine."
2. "I had a surgery years ago and I was just as scared as you were. It'll be fine."
3. "Okay, sounds like an issue to address with your friends."
4. "I will carefully transfer you to the OR bed and will protect any pressure points and bony prominences with extra padding. Your back and neck will be supported to prevent stiffness while also maintaining appropriate respiratory and circulatory functions. What are some other concerns you have?"

Answer: 4

Rationale: Nursing management for surgical procedures follow the main practice of providing and advocating for the safety and well-being of the patient. Since the emotional state is a common concern for patients, the nursing staff must provide the patient with information about their plan of care and reassurance for the unknown. The nurse must thoroughly reiterate the importance of their safety, ensure both emotional and physical support, and support coping strategies and reinforcement to the patient's abilities that can effect their post-operative outcome.  Option 4 is the most important and appropriate way of communicating with the patient to establish a therapeutic connection between the nurse and patient, showcasing the responsibilities of the surgical team, and identifies any risks or concerns that can be expressed prior to surgery.

**What potential challenges and considerations should surgical personnel be mindful of when using the Trendelenburg positioning during surgery?**

A) Enhanced surgical site exposure and improved instrument handling
B) Risk of postoperative hypoxia and atelectasis
C) Decreased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE)
D) Shorter surgical duration and reduced anesthesia requirements

Answer:
B) Risk of postoperative hypoxia and atelectasis

Rationale:
The Trendelenburg position, with the head down and feet up, is typically used during surgical procedures to increase exposure of the surgical site (usually in abdominal procedures). Something to be aware of is the increased risk of postoperative hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and atelectasis (lung collapse) when using the Trendelenburg position. A steep Trendelenburg position can increase physiologic strain on the patient's body, increase upper airway resistance and intraocular pressure and cause conjunctival edema. The redistribution of blood and airflow in the lungs due to the head-down position can impair ventilation and oxygenation.

**A patient scheduled to have colorectal surgery will be positioned in the Trendelenburg position. What precautions does the surgical nurse know to take in order to prevent complications associated with this surgical position? Select all that apply.**

a. Assess for risk factors for postoperative vision loss
b. Measure a shoulder brace to prevent sliding
c. Flex the patient's knees
d. Frequently reposition the patient and level them from Trendelenburg
e. Keeping the bed angle at greater than 30-45 degrees

Answer: a, c, d

Rationale: A: The Trendelenburg greatly increases the risk of high intraocular pressure (IOP) during surgery and postoperative vision loss (POVL). C: The patient's knees should be flexed so as not to place tension on the median nerve and joints. D: Although this may increase the surgery time, repositioning should be done so the patient can be level for short intervals of time. If the patient is suspended in the Trendelenburg position for extended periods of time, it increases their risk of many postoperative complications, such as POVL, cerebral perivascular edema, and long-term respiratory conditions. B: A shoulder brace is advised against because it places too much pressure on the shoulders; instead, the use of convoluted foam, viscoelastic gel overlays, or vacuum-packed positioning devices is recommended. E: the bed should be as level as possible for the indicated surgery, and should never exceed 45 degrees.

**Which is not true about the munro scale?**

1. It prevents all pressure ulcers.
2. It identifies risk factors for pressure ulcer development.
3. It's a documentation/communication tool for risk scores for pressure ulcer development.
4. It increases the frequency of risk assessments.

answer: 1

Answer choices 2, 3 and 4 are true. The Munro scale helps identify risk factors that may cause surgical patients to develop pressure ulcers. It creates a common language and a standardized tool so all medical professionals are on the same page and understand how at-risk specific patients are for pressure injuries and how we can try to prevent them. In order to figure out the Munro score, healthcare professionals need to assess the patient closely and then document and communicate their findings. Answer choice 1 is not true in regards to the Munro score because even though it is a preventative tool it is not guaranteed to prevent ALL pressure ulcers.

**What positioning would a patient be at risk for incresed post operative vision loss? (Select All)**

1. Trendelenburg
2. Lateral
3. Supine
4. Prone
5. Lithotomy

Answer/Rationale: 1, 4 are the correct answers because in trendelenburg and prone the patient has the risk of compromised blood flow to the optic nerve and can cause post operative vision loss.

**A patient undergoing a lower abdominal is placed in Trendelenburg. After examining the abdomen and completing several surgical interventions, the surgeon requests that the bed be transitioned to a flat position. The student nurse in the corner knows that the surgeon is concerned about the patient staying in Trendelenburg for a long period of time due to which of these possible complications: (Select all that apply)**

a. increased intraocular pressure

b. increased pressure in legs

c. brachial plexus neuropathy

d. excessive flexion of limbs

Answers: A and C

The Trendelenburg position causes blood pooling towards the head, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and increased intraocular pressure. In some extreme cases, patients who underwent a surgery in the Trendelenburg position can develop postoperative vision loss (POVL). Another risk of the Trendelenburg position is nerve damage in the brachial plexus region due to excessive pressure on the shoulder.

Answer B is not correct because the patient would not experience increased pressure in their legs. Answer D is incorrect because Trendelenburg doesn't usually involve the flexion of limbs.

**Question: Your patient is scheduled for an open partial nephrectomy (partial removal of kidney). What position would you place your patient in for the surgery?**

```
Prone

Trendelenburg

Lateral

Lithotomy

```

Answer: 3

Rationale: Choice 3 is appropriate positioning for this patient. Placing the patient on their side allows for easier access to the kidney that needs to be operated on. Prone is more often used in spinal surgeries, Trendelenburg for abdominal surgeries where organs need to be shifted using gravity, and lithotomy for gynecological procedures.

**The scrub nurse and the circulating nurse notice a discrepancy during sponge count. What is the first action the circulating nurse should take?**

A. file an occurrence report

B. notify the manager of the unit

C. re-count the sponges to make sure

D. stop the surgery

Answer: C

Rationale: The first action the circulating nurse should take is to re-count the sponges to make sure an actual accident occurred. This could be just a miscommunication or miscount therefore the answer is C. If there is still a discrepancy in sponge count and it is has been verified, then you must notify the surgical team. If the patient's condition allows, temporarily suspend the surgery to search for missing item.  This means searching in the surgical site, floor, trash, extc. If the item is found, a re-count would need to be done to verify. If the item is still not found, an x ray would need to be done to locate it. An occurrence report and documentation needs to be done after the situation has been settled.

**Question: A 37-year-old male patient is scheduled for a 4-hour colorectal surgery. The patient has a BMI of 30, diabetic, and anemic. In this case, what factors contribute to putting the patient at risk of pressure injuries? (select all that apply).**

```
Age
Gender
BMI
Comorbidities
Procedure Type
Surgery duration
Anesthesiologists' access to patient

```

Answer: 3, 4, 5, 6,7

Rationale: When assessing the risks you look at the patient’s age, but the 37-year-old patient still hasn’t met the requirement of their age putting them at risk (60+). While gender is important in other aspects, gender was not mentioned as a risk for pressure injuries. You also want to consider their BMI (malnourished or obese) and their comorbidities (vascular, pulmonary, renal diseases, etc.). In this case, the patient is obese, diabetic, and anemic which all play a role in increasing their risk. Next, you can look at the procedure type and planned position (including the patient's tolerance). The patient is undergoing colorectal surgery which is safe to say they will most likely use the prone position. Both of these factors play a part in increasing their risk. Another thing to look at would be the duration of the surgery. Typically a surgery of 3-4 hours+ increases their risk as the patients aren’t able to move themselves or the staff due to the surgery circumstances. Considering the patient will be in a prone position, you have to consider the access the anesthesiologist has to the patient's airway (which will be more difficult). Although this wasn’t an answer choice, considering any external factors such as planned hypothermia, the use of re-tractors or tourniquets is also important.

**You are positioning and preparing a patient for surgery. You know the surgeon will be using a ESU/Bovie. What should the nurse avoid when placing the return pad on the patient. SELECT ALL THAT APPLY**

```
Hairy surfaces
Bony prominences
Well vascularized site with lots of muscle tissue
Metal prosthetics
Sites located near the incision.

```

Answers: A, B, D

Rationale: Per the latest guidelines, the ESU return pad should be placed as close as possible to the operative site. The area should be clean, dry and well vascularized over over a large muscle group. Bony prominences, scar tissue, skin over metal implants, tattoos and hairy surfaces should be avoided. Option A is correct because it avoids hairy surfaces which may impact electrical conduction or prevent the pad from sticking.  Option B is correct because you should avoid bony prominences, which have less tissue to dissipate electrical energy which could harm the patient. Option C is incorrect as well vascularized sites over muscles groups are ideal. Option D is correct as areas over metal implants should be avoided. Metal implants  can significantly alter the flow of electrical current, potentially leading to unpredictable energy distribution. The metal can act as a conductor, concentrating electrical energy in the surrounding tissues, which can result in burns, tissue damage, and complications during surgery. Option E is incorrect as per the guidelines, the ESU pad should be placed as close as possible to the incision. However, the priority should be healthy tissue that takes into the other considerations listed above.

**The circulating nurse is getting ready for the first surgery of the day - a hernia repair. While she is gathering supplies, she knows she has to get sutures. Which suture should be used for this surgery?**

A. Multifilament non-absorbable silk suture

B.  Multifilament non-absorbable fiberwire suture

C. Monofilament non-absorbable prolene suture

D. Multifilament non-absorbable ethibond suture

Answer: D

Rationale: The nurse knows that multifilament non-absorbable ethibond sutures are most commonly used for hernia repairs. Multifilament non-absorbable silk suture are used for chest tube stitches. Multifilament non-absorbable fiberwire suture are used for tendon or ligament repairs. Monofilament non-absorbable prolene suture are used for vascular repairs.

**Which of these choices is NOT a safe positioning practice to prevent patient injury?**

A. Maintaining physiological alignment

B. Avoiding excessive flexion/extension of limbs

C. Applying safety devices in a secure matter

D. Making sure no one is at the patient's bedside while they're on the OR table

Correct answer: D

Rationale: The perioperative team should identify potential hazards having to do with positioning activities to prevent patient injuries. Some safe practices are maintaining physiological alignment, avoiding excessive flexion or extension of limbs, and applying safety devices in a secure matter. The perioperative team should be selecting the team member who will remain at the patient's side when they are on the OR bed beforehand, which is why D is correct.

**You are the nursing student in the OR and notice that the temperature has been set to 84 degrees Fahrenheit. Possible effects of this temperature setting include ____________.  SELECT ALL THAT APPLY**

A) Staff discomfort

B) Hypothermia

C) Occupational heat stress

D) Contamination of the sterile field

E) Damage to ESU

Answer: A, C, D. Temperature settings above the reference range may cause discomfort, leading to perspiration that may contaminate the sterile field. Studies also show that heat can cause occupational heat stress, which can lead to decreased psychomotor and cognitive abilities in surgeons.

**The nurse is getting a patient ready for surgery. The patient's procedure is a total arthroplasty of the right shoulder. The nurse knows that the patient will be positioned in what _____ prior to the start of the operation.**

A: prone

B: lateral

C: lateral decubitus/beach chair

D: supine

correct answer: C

rationale: The optimum patient positioning for shoulder arthroscopy should enhance intraoperative joint visualization and surgical accessibility while minimizing potential perioperative risk to the patient. Most shoulder arthroscopy procedures can be reliably performed with the patient either in the lateral decubitus (LD) or beach chair (BC) position to minimize pressure or more inures to the shoulder. This also provides the surgical team with a better angle during the procedure.

**The circulating nurse and scrub technician begin count before the completion of a small bowel obstruction surgery. The scrub technician found that they received a different count of lap sponges compared to the circulating nurse. What is the best next step the circulating nurse should take?**

1. Notify X-ray to obtain an abdominal scan
2. Re-count all of the sponges
3. Inform the surgeon about the discrepancy
4. Begin to search through trash and see if it was thrown out

Answer: 2

Answer choice 2 is the correct answer because when there is a discrepancy in count between the scrub tech and nurse, it is always a good idea to recount before freaking out. There could just be a simple misunderstanding that could be corrected through effective communication. Answer choice 1 is incorrect because it is not in the nurse's scope of practice to order an X-ray. Although there is a possibility that a sponge could have been left in the patient's abdominal cavity, all other precautions should be taken before X-ray gets involved.  It is the surgeon's responsibility to make that decision. Answer choice 3 is incorrect because the nurse and the scrub tech should double-check, and maybe even triple-check, to see if there is truly a discrepancy. Lastly, answer choice 4 is incorrect because once again, the scrub tech and nurse should recount before looking through the trash.

**Prior to starting the surgery, the OR team does their Time Out. Which of the following is included in the checklist? (Select all that apply)**

```
Correct patient
Correct procedure
Correct playlist
Correct site

```

Answer: 1, 2, 4

Rationale: Time Out focuses on patient’s safety. Thus, knowing if we have the right patient, right procedure that’s gonna be performed at the right site ensures no complications/issues the OR team may run into. Knowing what type of music to play in the OR is not important as it doesn’t influence patient’s safety.

**The OR nurse arrives into the surgery room, to prepare for a lower abdomen procedure. Which of the following actions should be NOT be implemented?**

A. ensuring that safety belt is on patient

B. extra padding should be used on patient's arms and their arm tucked in securely with draw sheet

C. using shoulder braces to prevent sliding on patient who is in Trendelenburg position

D. neurophysiological monitoring

Answer: C

It is important to make sure that the patient always has their safety belt on and that there is always someone keeping an eye on the patient to prevent falls. The patient's arms should be tucked to their sided and be padded to prevent any pressure ulcers. A shoulder braces is NOT recommended to be used as it can result in excess pressure on the acromion, injuring the brachial plexus. Neurophysiological monitoring is used to detect early signs of nervous system damage and repositioning will occur to prevent nerve damage.

**Question: Before placing the safety strap on a patient positioned on the operating table, what is the most appropriate statement you should tell them to communicate the purpose of the safety strap?**

1. "I am using this device to strap you down to the operating table."
2. "This strap will secure you so you don't fall off the operating table."
3. "I am going to put on this is a safety belt, it is just like a seat belt."
4. "This device will restrain you to the operating table."

Answer: 3

Rationale: When applying the safety strap, you want to avoid saying anything that may make the patient more nervous or uncomfortable right before their procedure. Comparing the belt to something that they are familiar with, like a seat belt, helps reduce concerns/anxiety/fear of their surgery. Words like strap down or restrain can have negative connotations to the patient and saying it is to prevent falling off the table may cause them to worry about it happening.

**Where should the bovie pad be placed on patient's body prior to the start of surgery?**

A. Close to the operative side over a muscular area

B. Close to the operative side over a bony prominence

C. Opposite to the operative side over a muscular area

D. Close to the operative side over scar tissue

Answer: A

Rationale:

Option A is the correct answer because if the pad is closer to the operative side, then less electrical current has to flow through the patient's body, and the pad should be placed over a muscular area because muscle dissolves heat quickly, so there is a reduced risk of a burn injury. Options B and D are incorrect because if the pads are placed over a bony prominence or scar tissue, this may result in an injury/burn at the pad site, since the heat won't dissolve as quickly. Option C is incorrect because if the pad is on the opposite side, then the electrical current will have to flow a further distance in the patient's body, which may increase the risk of the harmful effects of electricity (Cordero, 2015).

**You are a circulating nurse scheduled for a 5-hour long laminectomy (procedure of the spine).  It's 2 hours into surgery, and you notice some things need to be addressed. What should you address first?**

A. A bag of trash is sitting in the corner of the room.

B. The temperature of the OR is set as 78F.

C. A surgical equipment that is not needed anymore accidentally fell onto the floor.

D. A nursing student is playing with their phone.

Answer: B

B is correct because the temperature of the OR should be 68-75F. If the OR gets too hot, it causes issues with the surgical performance of the surgeon, a higher risk of contamination, therefore leading to bad outcomes for the patient. A is incorrect because all the trash created from the procedure needs to stay in the room until the procedure is finished. C is wrong because the equipment is no longer going to be used, thus not urgent. D is wrong because although it needs to be addressed, B directly contributes to the surgeon's performance and the patient's well being.

**What are some of the roles of the circulating nurse during the intraoperative period? Select all that apply.**

a. avoiding any type of injury to the patient

b. patient comfort

c. preventing falls and injury during transport and transfer

d. obtaining the patients phone number

e. to remain sterile

Answer: A,B,C

Rationale: During the intraoperative phase, the circulating nurse must make sure that the patient's safety in the operating room environment is maintained by making sure that the equipment is in working order, preventing accidental injuries during transport and transfer, keeping a watchful eye on asepsis, and being with the patient during anesthesia induction.

**The nurse is caring for a patient undergoing an appendectomy. Which method should the perioperative nurse use to protect the patient's arms during positioning?**

Answer: 5. All of the above

Rationale: Patients undergoing surgery are at increased risk for complications such as nerve injury, body shifting, and pressure injury. Perioperative personnel should be aware of potential hazards associated with positioning. If a patient is supine, incorrect positioning may lead to ulnar nerve injury or upper-limb compartment syndrome. The nurse should practice safe positioning practices including maintaining anatomical alignment, avoiding excessive flexion/extension of limbs, and utilizing safety devices (ex. safety straps). All four of these methods maintain physiological alignment, avoid any extension of limbs, and utilize safety devices such as arms board and safety straps.

**When a patient is in the operation room, what is typically automatically suspended due to patient consent and why?**

A. Power of attorney making medical decisions for the patient is suspended due to the person not being in the room to making the decisions, so the medical team ends up deciding.

B. Do not resuscitate (DNR) orders are suspended because there is a higher likely chance of CPR survival in the perioperative setting especially due to the patient’s vital functions being deliberately depressed by anesthesia.

C. Living will is suspended because the written consent has not updated since 10 years ago.

D. Nothing can get suspended or changed in the OR due to the fact that the medical team is unable to make changes an hour before a procedure.

Answer: B

Rationale: Patients and family may not be aware of the resuscitative efforts and treatment plans that may take place within an operating room (OR) because to the fast physiologic changes that may happen there.  Answer A is incorrect because the medical team will reach out to the power of attorney and if they are unavailable, then in the state of Ohio, the next of kin is the one needed to make the patient's medical decisions. Answer B is correct because DNR orders are routinely suspended in many healthcare facilities thanks to practices and regulations that apply when patients proceed to the OR.  Several treatments that are frequently utilized during "resuscitation," like as vasopressors and mechanical breathing, are also used when the patient's vital functions are purposefully reduced by anesthetic. To ensure stable vital functions in the presence of a DNR order, an anesthesiologist may need to postpone such operations or even lower the amount of anesthesia and analgesia. Either action could have an adverse effect on the surgical outcome. To avoid these situations, many doctors would prefer to "suspend" DNR orders in the operating room. The fact that CPR is far more effective in the operating room than it is elsewhere in the hospital lends weight to this strategy. Answer C is incorrect because a living will is viable until the patient cancels it. Answer D is incorrect because a DNR is able to be changed anytime before a procedure as long as the patient is aware, fully functioning, and not medicated by any anesthesia yet and gives consent.

**What kind of considerations should the surgeon consider for a patient going into lithotomy procedure?**

A. Lumbar and sacral pressure

B. Hip and knee joint injury

C. Pressure on elevated leg

D. All of the above

Rationale:

The lithotomy procedure involves the patient placed on the back with legs being flexed 90 degrees at the hips. The knees would be bent 70-90 degrees depending on the surgeon. A prolonged surgery could cause a compartment syndrome on the lower extremities, cause pressure on the elevated leg, venous obstruction near the inguinal region, insufficient perfusion, lumbar and sacral pressure, hip and knee joint injury. Because of this, the healthcare team should make sure to position the patient correctly and also place pads on places that necessary to prevent any pressures and joint injuries.

**All of these create a higher risk for pressure injuries EXCEPT:**

1. anesthetic agents
2. immobility
3. lack of position change
4. age
5. safety straps

Correct answer: 5

Rationale: Anesthetic agents cause a greater risk for pressure injuries because they decrease muscle tone, which can cause an increase pressure between bones and surfaces. Not moving and laying in one spot for long surgeries can cause pressure injuries. Older adults have thinner skin, and similar to the anesthetic agents, the thin skin does not create a tough barrier between bones and surfaces. Safety straps, when used correctly, will not cause pressure injuries because they are not applying force onto the patient and tend to me over the legs and stomach. The nurse should make sure the straps are not tight enough to cause an ulcer.

**Kim is the circulating nurse for a spine surgery to remove a tumor.  The patient is a 75-year-old female with a BMI of 17 and a Braden score of 14. What position should the patient be in and what pressure points should Kim be aware of?**

A. Prone; breast, face, knees, shoulders, and toes

B. Prone; breast

C. Prone; breast, face, elbows, and toes

D. Lateral; breast, face, knees, shoulders, toes

E. Prone; breast and heels of the feet

Answer: A

Explanation: The easiest way to perform surgery on the spine is to gain access through the back while the patient is in a prone position. All positions put pressure on bony prominences. However, in the prone position the breast, face (chin and forehead), knees, shoulders, and toes are all spots in the body that should be padded, as too much pressure could cause injury to these areas. The elbows wouldn't be under pressure since the patient is in a prone position so C is incorrect. The patient would not be in a lateral position because that does not allow adequate access and exposure for the surgeon so D is incorrect. Finally, the heels of the feet would not be under pressure since they're facing upward so E is incorrect.
