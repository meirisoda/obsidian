# Quiz 3 Discussion Board Questions

**What does a score of 8 or higher indicate on the Aldrete Scoring System?**

A. Patient is suitable for discharge from PACU

B. Patient should not be discharged from the PACU

C. Patient needs to get intubated immediately

D. This scoring system does not determine if a patient should get discharged from the PACU

Correct Answer: A

Rationale: The aldrete scoring system is made up of 5 components, which include: activity, respiration, circulation, consciousness, and oxygenation. A patient can score either a 0, 1, or 2 for each component for a maximum score of 10. Zero means that the patient needs to remain in the PACU, and a score of 2 means they are suitable enough to be discharged from PACU based on that specific component. Answer A is the correct answer because this means that patient would have scored mostly all 2's for each component, which is why they should be discharged from PACU. B and C are incorrect because this would indicate scores lower than 8. D is incorrect because this scale is used to determine if a patient is discharged from PACU.

**A nurse is providing care to a patient in the post-anesthesia care unit after a major abdominal surgery. The patient reported having an 8 out of 10 pain and has been receiving opioid analgesics for pain management. The nurse observes the patient exhibiting shallow respirations, a decreased level of consciousness, and a respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute. What action should the nurse prioritize?**

A) Administer naloxone (Narcan) as ordered.
B) Increase the rate of the IV opioid infusion.
C) Provide oxygen via a nasal cannula.
D) Assess the surgical incision for signs of infection.

Answer:
A) Administer naloxone (Narcan) as ordered.

Rationale:
Shallow respirations, decreased level of consciousness, and a respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute suggests opioid overdose or opioid-induced respiratory depression. Administering Narcan is the top priority intervention in this situation. Prompt administration of naloxone can be life-saving in cases of opioid overdose.

Increasing the rate of the IV opioid infusion would worsen the opioid overdose and respiratory depression. Providing oxygen via a nasal cannula is important (in order to provide oxygenation), but it does not address the underlying overdose. Assessing the surgical incision for signs of infection is essential in postoperative care but is not the priority when the patient is experiencing life-threatening respiratory depression due to opioids.

**A nursing preceptor is teaching her student about the importance of immediate post-operative care and what are some expectations when providing for the patient. What is the most significant information the nurse should be mentioned to the student as the main goal for the patient?**

a. Contact the family every hour about the pt's condition

b. Play the patient's choice of music to reduce anxiety

c. Organize the room to ensure safety is set for when the patient wakes up.

d. The primary intervention is maintaining ventilation and preventing complications such as hypoxemia (reduced oxygen in the blood) and hypercapnia (excess carbon dioxide in the blood).

Answer: D

Rationale: Both hypercapnia and hypoxemia are the two most critical and commonly seen risks for a patient undergoing post-operative care. Both are possible of occurring when the airway is obstructed and or if there is a decrease in ventilation (hypoventilation). The nursing priorities in preventing these complications is administering supplemental oxygen (as prescribed), asses respiratory rate/depth, oxygen saturation, and breath sounds. Occlusion of the airway is at higher risk during post-operative care due to unconsciousness and relaxation of the muscle in the pharynx. Thus, although the other options are important interventions, they are not as significant as choice D, which puts the patient's safety as the primary priority.

**Phase one focuses on...**

a.) keeping the patient sedated so that they don't experience any pain

b.) monitoring as the patient wakes up from anesthesia and waiting for vitals to return to baseline, Q5 vitals

c.) preparing patient for discharge or transfer, Q15 vitals

d.) sedating the patient before the procedure begins

correct answer: b

B is the correct answer because phase one of recovery emphasis is on making sure the patient fully wakes up from anesthesia and monitoring vitals every 5 minutes. In phase one the nurses are responsible for helping make the pt comfortable and relieving their pain. This includes ice packs, heating pads, bedpans and urinals. Phase 2 focuses on preparing the patient for discharge or transfer, Q15 vitals and educating the patient and family.

**Which of the following is NOT a class 1:2 in phase 1 of a patient in the PACU coming from the OR?**

A. One patient unconscious airway stable, no complications and second patient conscious, stable and no complications

B. Two conscious patients, stable, and no complications, but not yet met discharge criteria

C. One patient unconscious with hemodynamic instability and second patient conscious, stable, and no complications

D. Two conscious patient, under 8 years old with parents present, but not yet met discharge criteria

Answer: C

Rationale: Phase one emphasis is on ensuring the patient's full recovery from anesthesia and return of vital signs to near baseline. A class 1:2 is where there is one nurse to two patients when in the PACU. These examples are general descriptions of examples that could be class 1:2; however, every hospital has different protocols and rules for what is considered allowed for a class 1:2 in phase 1. The most common nurse to patient ratio is class 1:1 where there is one nurse to one patient. This question is also asking about which is NOT a 1:2 ratio. Answer A is incorrect because that is an example of class 1:2 due to both patients being stable and no complications, even though one of them is unconscious. Answer B is incorrect because both patients are conscious, stable, and no complications, so it could be a class 1:2. Answer C is correct because if a patient is unconscious with hemodynamic instability, then that needs to be a class 1:1. Answer D is incorrect because in some hospitals two conscious patients under 8 years old with parents present can be a class 1:2.

**The nurse is providing discharge instructions to a 60 year old female patient who had a total right hip arthroplasty. Which statement made by the patient indicates that further teaching is required? Select all that apply.**

A. It is normal to have a high temperature of102F because this is my body adjusting to a new hip.

B. I need to avoid strenuous activity such as heavy lifting and jumping.

C. I will need to schedule a follow up appointment with my surgeon 2 weeks from the date of my surgery.

D. I can return to work the next day because I have a new and more functional hip!

E. If the incision site is not bleeding, then I am good.

Answer: A, D, E

Rationale: It is not normal to have a high temperature of 102 F. In fact, high temperature may indicate infection which is serious and your surgeon needs to be contacted. After a hip arthroplasty, it is advised to avoid strenuous activity to prevent injury. Patients need to make a follow up appointment to check in on the condition of the new hip and make sure everything is okay. It is not advised that patients go back to work soon after. Patients need to rest. Patients should assess not only bleeding but also opening, drainage, swelling, redness, or changes in color. It is important to note these things so infection can be minimized. Additionally, a bit of bleeding is good because it means the site is well vascularized.

**The nurse asks the nursing student about general anesthesia. Which of the following statements DOES NOT requires further education about general anesthesia?**

A) There is a purposeful response given after repeated/painful stimulation.

B) Airway is unaffected.

C) Spontaneous ventilation is usually inadequate.

D) Cardiovascular function is usually unaffected.

Answ: C

According to the ASA, choice A is describing Deep sedation/analgesia. Choice B is describing minimal sedation. Choice C is correct. CHoice D is describing minimal sedation. The responsiveness for general anesthesia is no response even with painful stimulation. Intervention is usually required for airway. Spontaneous ventilation is frequently inadequate. And cardiovascular function may be impaired.

**When the patient is going to the PACU, which things should the circulator nurse include in their report? (select all that apply)**

1. Allergies
2. Procedure
3. Family updated
4. Meds
5. EBL (estimated blood loss)

Answer: all the choices (1-5)

Rational: During the postop phase, the circulating nurse will give report to the PACU nurse who is accepting the patients. It's important to include allergies, type of procedure done, where family updated, meds given (prior & during surgery), and the amount of blood loss that may occur. This way the PACU nurse knows what are priorities for this patient.

**What factors can help foster a positive and educational environment for nursing students? (select all apply)**

A. Nursing mentors providing adequate support when needed

B. Mentors with many years of experience in the clinical setting

C. Mentors who do not go through proper training

D. Having a student-centered clinical setting

Answers: A, B, D

A is correct because having support for students is important, because this is a time when they need guidance and knowledge. B is correct because having more experience in the clinical setting can ensure the mentor knows what they're doing, and can educate from experience. D is correct because having a student-centered clinical setting foster a good learning environment, and students wouldn't be left out of good teaching opportunities. C is incorrect because this will create a gap between different mentors and clinical groups, thus creating gaps and differences in the amount of learning different groups can learn.

**Imagine you are an OR nurse bringing your patient to the PACU. When you are giving the PACU nurse report what are some important details about the patient to include? SELECT ALL THAT APPLY**

1. Procedure/ surgery performed
2. Type of sedation given
3. Favorite tv channel
4. Medications given in the OR
5. Name & date of birth
6. Allergies

Answer: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6

Rationale: The PACU nurse needs to have the name and date of birth to confirm that you are bringing them the correct patient, and should be made aware of patient allergies. The PACU nurse also needs to know what sedation and medications the patient has received in case they begin to not feel well, meds given to attempt to help the patient may interact with the meds given in the OR. The PACU nurse will have to chart and observe the surgical site therefore, they need to be aware of where to look. It may be a nice addition to tell the PACU nurse what your patient’s favorite channel is but, it has no real importance on patient safety and care.

**During a patient hand over, as the circulating RN, select all pertinent information to give to the PACU nurse.**

a. patient name and DOB

b. procedure that was performed

c. antibiotics administered

d. what anesthesia they were given

e. insurance information

Answer:

a, b, c, d

Rationale: A-D are all important pieces of information to include in the report a circulating nurse gives during hand off. It's important to include these pieces of information so the patients PACU care can be as stable as possible. E doesn't need to be given to the PACU nurse since it's not relevant in the moment.

**The nurse is aware that the following should NOT be included in the patient pre-sedation assessment prior to administering MSA:**

A. vital signs

B. drug and alcohol use

C. physical and sensory limitations

D. preference of sedation used

E.  levels of pain and anxiety

Answer: D

Before administering MSA (moderate sedation and analgesia), AORN recommends nurses and LIPs perform a presedation patient assessment to ensure the patient is a candidate for MSA and then document the assessment results. AORN recommends that the presedation patient assessment include a review of the patient’s: allergies, vital signs, lung sounds and airway status, age, height, weight, and body mass index, relevant medical and surgical history, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), medications, including over-the-counter therapies, alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug use, relevant diagnostic and laboratory test results, physical and sensory limitations, levels of pain and anxiety.

**Which of these priorities are associated with Phase I in the PACU? (select all that apply)**

1. Stable airway with adequate ventilation and oxygenation
2. Hemodynamic stability
3. Mobility
4. Manage analgesia and PONV
5. Oral intake
6. Education for discharge
7. Prescriptions
8. Discontinue or adapt IV

Correct answers: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8

Rationale: Possible complications in Phase I of recovery include compromised airway, cardiovascular depression, and pain, which is why priorities include maintaining an airway, monitoring hemodynamic stability, and managing analgesia. Oral intake is accounted for in both Phase I and II of recovery. Mobility, discharge instructions, and prescriptions are not accounted for until phase II of recovery.

**Which sedation score is on a scale from 1-8 where 1 represents awake and alert, minimal or no cognitive impairment, and 8 represents unresponsive to external stimuli, including pain?**

```
POSS: Pasero Opioid Induced Sedation Scale
Aldrete: Modified Aldrete
Ramsey Sedation Scale
RASS:  Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale

```

Answer: 3. Ramsey Sedation Scale

Rationale: The POSS: Pasero Opioid Induced Sedation Scale a scale of 5 components; S: sleep, easy to arouse, 1: awake and alert, 2:  Slightly drowsy, easily aroused, 3: frequently drowsy, arousable, drifts off to sleep during conversation, and 4: Somnolent, minimal or no response to verbal and physical stimulation.

The modified Aldrete score is measured by evaluating five criteria, including the individual's activity level, respiration, circulation, consciousness, and oxygen saturation. A score of “0”, “1”, or “2” is given for each category, two representing the ideal condition.

The Ramsey Sedation Scale divides a patient's level of sedation into eight categories ranging from severe agitation to deep coma. Despite its frequent use, the Ramsay Sedation Scale has shortcomings in patients with complex cases.

The Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) is a user-friendly and therefore commonly used sedation scale, with scores ranging from +4 (a violent dangerous patient) to −5 (an unarousable patient).

**The surgical team is entering the postoperative phase for the patient. While the scrub nurse is storing instruments properly, the circulating nurse is going to start cleaning and dressing the patient's wounds and is teaching the student nurse the proper way to dress wounds to prevent surgical site infections. The circulating nurse knows that reteaching is required when the student makes which statement?**

A. "You should always dress wounds from clean to dirty."

B. "You should wear clean gloves when dressing wounds."

C. "In order to maintain sterility, do not touch the surface underneath the dressing before it comes in contact with the patient's wound."

D. "We should remove the drapes before the wounds are dressed in order to keep a sterile field."

Answer: D

Rationale: The circulating nurse knows that that the student nurse needs to be retaught when the student states that the drapes should be removed before the wounds are dressed. This is wrong because the unsterile sides of the drapes could come in contact with the wound, as well as particles that are being blown from the disturbed laminar downflow of air. You should always remove drapes after the wound is dressed. Dressing wounds should always be completed from clean to dirty since gloves could become contaminated. When dressing wounds, make sure that you have clean gloves on so as to not contaminate or cause an infection. The bottom of a dressing should remain undisturbed to remain sterility for a patient's wound. If it becomes stained or loose, the dressing should be removed and redone.

**You are a PACU nurse assigned to a patient whose vitals are at baseline and qualifies for PACU Stage II. You know that PACU Stage II is distinct from I and focuses on and/or requires the following (Select all that apply)**

```
Q15 Vital Signs
Return to baseline vitals with continuous pulse ox
Discharge planning
Scoring on the Postanesthetic Discharge Scoring System (PADSS) or Modified Aldrete scale
Continued supportive O2

```

Answers: A, C, D

Rationale: Answer A is is correct as the patient only needs occasional monitoring, as they have returned to baseline if the patient has transitioned to Stage II. Answer B looks correct, but continuous pulse ox is not indicated. The patient's VS should have stabilized. Answer is C is correct as Stage II of PACU focuses on preparing the patient for hospital discharge or transfer. This should include patient education, surgeon instructions, etc. Answer D is correct as scoring the patient on a standardized scale such as PADSS or Aldrete is helpful for assessing the patient and planning for discharge. For example, the PADSS score is based on vital signs, activity level, nausea or vomiting, pain, surgical bleeding, and intake and output. A pt. ready for dfor discharge typically include a PADSS score of 9 or better. Answer E is incorrect, but looks correct. The patient should have been weaned from O2 in preparation from discharge. Of course, the patient should still be monitored for any changes.

**Which of the following information about sedation is incorrect?**

A. Minimal Sedation: patient has a normal response to verbal stimulation, and is unaffected in airway, spontaneous ventilation, and cardiovascular function

B. Moderate Sedation/Analgesia: purposeful response to verbal/tactile stimulation, no intervention required for airway, adequate spontaneous ventilation, cardiovascular function is usually maintained.

C. Deep Sedation/Analgesia: purposeful response following repeated or painful stimulation, airway intervention may be required, spontaneous ventilation maybe inadequate, cardiovascular function is unaffected.

D. General Anesthesia: no response even with painful stimulus, airway intervention often required, cardiovascular function maybe impaired.

ANSWER: C; All of the information is correct besides "cardiovascular function is unaffected". For deep sedation, cardiovascular is usually maintained.

Which of the following is NOT part of the Phase I priorities during the post anesthesia period?

```
Stable airway with adequate ventilation and oxygenation
Education for discharge
Hemodynamic stability
Manage analgesia and PONV

```

Correct answer: B. Education for discharge

Rationale: The post anesthesia period is typically separated into three levels of care: Phase I, Phase II, and Extended Care. Phase I consists of prioritizing the patient's recovery from anesthesia and returning to baseline vital signs. The nurse must consider each patient's procedure, comorbidities, anesthesia, and physical status to properly minimize complications. After Phase I, the patient is transferred to Phase II (inpatient setting or ICU). Priorities in Phase I includes (but not limited to) stable airway with adequate ventilation and oxygenation, hemodynamic stability, manage analgesia and PONV, oral intake, and discontinue or continue IV. Although education for discharge is a very important aspect of postoperative care, it is more of a priority during Phase II of the post anesthesia period, considering this is when the nurse prepares the patient to ambulate, take nutrition, and receive education and instructions for self-management at home.

**The nursing student is shadowing a PACU nurse for the day and wants to assist the nurse with the Postoperative Assessment using the Modified Aldrete Score. After assessing three patients, which patient is ready for discharge according to the Modified Aldrete Scoring System?**

```
Bed 2: 45-year-old man who cannot move any extremities, breathes deeply, has blood pressure that is 20 mmHg greater than the preanesthetic level, coughs freely, and Is fully awake but requires supplemental oxygen to maintain a level greater than 90%: Aldrete Score - 7
Bed 4: 23-year-old woman who cannot move any extremities, is experiencing apnea, has a blood pressure that is 50 mmHg greater than the preanesthetic level, Is arousable when called on, and has an oxygen saturation less than 90% on supplemental oxygen: Aldrete Score - 1
Bed 6: 33-year-old woman who can move all extremities freely, breathes deeply and coughs freely, has a blood pressure that is 20 mmHg greater than the preanesthetic level, is fully awake, and has an oxygen saturation above 90% on room air: Aldrete Score: 10

```

Answer: 3

According to the Modified Aldrete Scoring System, the patient in bed 6 is ready for discharge because she is stable and can function on her own without any assistance, stimuli, or supplemental oxygen. Both beds 2 and 4 need supplemental oxygen and cannot move any extremities which means they'll need additional support and evaluations to determine if they're suitable for discharge. Bed 4 has more serious complications which should be reported to the surgeon or the anesthesiologist.

**The nurse manager assigns two perioperative nurses to a colonoscopy. One nurse prepares to monitor the patient receiving moderate sedation by gathering supplies. The nurse knows to sedation should not be started without gathering which supplies? Select all that apply.**

A. Nasal cannula

B. Cardiac monitor

C. 9-12 vials of dantrolene

D. Capnography device

E. Sonogram device

F. Suction source, tubing, and tip

Answer: A, B, D, F

Rationale: C is incorrect because dantrolene is used to reverse malignant hyperthermia. E is incorrect because moderate sedation does not require an ultrasound. In addition to a nasal cannula, cardiac monitor, capnography device, sonogram device, and suctioning equipment, the nurse should check that a pulse oximeter and BP measurement device are in the room, as well as immediate access to an oxygen source with oxygen tubing. All of these are necessary to monitor the patient’s breathing and level of consciousness during moderate sedation.

**Phase ___ emphasizes ensuring the patients full recovery from anesthesia and the return of vital signs near baseline through an airway assessment and vital sign check.**

1. one
2. two
3. three
4. four

Answer: phase one

rationale: post anesthesia requires special care from nurses because of the drugs side effects. After the procedure the nurse should ensure the patient can breathe properly, as respiratory depression is one of the most harmful side effects. The patient will get transferred to phase 1 area of PACU where an RN can closely monitor them until the anesthesia has worn off.

**A patient is transferred to Phase 1 in the PACU after surgery. The PACU nurse carefully monitors the patient's vital signs, pain level, and alertness as the patient wakes up from anesthesia. The nurse knows which of the following is not a criteria to move the patient to Phase 2?**

a. The patient has adequate airway and ventilatory status

b. The patient is able to move extremities on command

c. The patient is able to ambulate and sit in a chair

d. The patient is fully awake

Answer: C

Rationale:

In order for a patient to be discharged from Phase 1, a patient must have adequate airway and ventilatory status, maintain cardiac and hemodynamic stability, be able to move extremities on command, have adequate oxygen saturation on room air, and be fully awake. Ambulation is a criteria for discharge from Phase 2.

**Nurse Noel is floating to the PACU from the ICU. She is preparing to receive an admission from the OR. The patient Noel is receiving just had a Laminectomy and she is not too sure what to expect when the patient arrives! What should Nurse Noel's initial action be upon the patient's arrival?**

1. Check the physician's postoperative orders.
2. Assess the patient's IVs and patency
3. Assess the patient's pain score
4. Take a set of vital signs
5. Assess the patient for allergies

Rationale: Answer choice 4 is the only correct answer because the very first action a nurse should take when a patient is entering the PACU, is to obtain a set of vitals. We want to make sure that the patient is stable, especially because they are just waking up from anesthesia. The nurse will then also want to assess the patient's airway, and breathing rate. We want to make sure the patient is as stable as possible. All other answer choices are incorrect because these are actions that can be completed after assessing the patient’s vitals and stability.

**The Aldrete score consists of what five categories? Select all that apply.**

```
Activity
Lifestyle
Respiration
Circulation
Consciousness
Gender
Skin color

```

Answer: A,C,D,E,G

Rationale: The Aldrete score is used to help determine the patient's readiness to be safely discharged from the PACU to whatever place is planned for them. The Aldrete score comprises five categories: activity (ability to move extremities voluntarily), respiration (patient's ability to breathe), circulation (patient’s blood pressure), consciousness (patient’s state of alertness), and skin color.

**Which of the following situations is not considered a part of the 1:1 nurse to patient ratio in the PACU (select all that apply).**

1. Unconscious child under the age of 8.
2. A patient with airway instability.
3. When a patient has an oral airway in place.
4. A patient who requires manual jaw thrust or chin lift.
5. A child who is conscious under the age of 8, with parents present, but did not meet d/c criteria.

Rationale: 4 + 5

Situation 4 is a critical situation and requires 2 nurses to one patient. Situation 5 is considered a 1:2 ratio as it is not a life threatening situation and the child is conscious. The nurse is not allowed to leave the bedside when the patient is unconscious and has an oral airway in. The nurse's priority assessment is airway and that is the first thing they will asses when the patient arrives in the PACU.

**Which of the following are an important assessment to obtain during the presedation patient assessment? (SELECT ALL THAT APPLY)**

A) Lung sounds and airway status

B) BMI

C) ASA Classification

D) NPO status

E) Alcohol and drug use

Answer: ALL are correct choices. AORN recommends a review of the patient's vitals, allergies, airway status, BMI, age, relevant history such as OSA, medication use, alcohol and drug use, NPO status, levels of pain and anxiety, and anesthesia/medication reactions. Furthermore, patients with ASA classification level 3 or higher should be consulted with an LIP or anesthesiologist before sedation.
