**Surgical Asepsis**: state of being free from disease causing microorganisms
→ **asepsis** is a process to eliminate those microorganisms before they can contaminate a sterile field
**sterile**: free from bacteria and other microorganisms

### Four common aspects of aseptic technique
**Barriers**: PPE
- Prevent iatrogenic events or infection
- contaminated surgical scrubs lead to bacteria or pathogenic organisms (laundry at home can't achieve high water temperature)
- frequently change PPE such as gloves, masks and gowns
- perspiration (dripping, cloughing, evaporation) can lead to MRSA infections
- Hand hygiene
    - no nail polish or fake nails
    - No jewelry on their hands or wrist
    - Hands free sinks, splash guards

**Environmental**: equipment, lights, air filter, temperature, humidity, traffic etc.
- 68-72F → Maintain a cold temperature to prevent perspiration
- Relative humidity (20-60%)
- Cleaning solutions contain quaternary ammonium and isopropyl alcohol
- 2 minute contact time for effective disinfection of any pathogens

**Situational**: SPD (sterile processing dpt) / clean and sterilize
- Autoclave uses moist saturate heat sterilization under pressure (increased pressure raises the temp of the boiling water)
- Thermolabile processes parts that cannot be immersed in water
- Manual is using chemical cleaning materials manually

**Personal**: skin prep (alcohol based, chg wipes)
- This is the highest preventable spot
- Wash your fucking hands
- Might lead to SSI (surgical site infections), HAIs
    - SSI (80% staph on skin)
    - **Reduce** by using preop decolonization, bathing, hair management
    - Skin prep by **selecting, applying and handling** antiseptics properly
    - Perop bathing done the night prior to or day of invasive surgery
    - Mupirocin ointment 3-5 days prevent MRSA (nasal decolonization)
- Skin prep
    - Perform hand hygiene
    - Sterile gloves
    - Fluid resistant pad under prep area to absorb excess prep solution

Preop Phone call

- Id patient, procedure, time/location, transportation and caregiver
- Instructions (no lotions, powders, jewelry, contacts)
- food/beverage/meals
