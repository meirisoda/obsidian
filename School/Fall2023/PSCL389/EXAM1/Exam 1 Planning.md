**Valence** (negative to positive)
**Arousal** (low to high)
Dominance (low to high)
**Discrete** (universal set of single, primary emotions, such as anger, sadness, happiness)
**Dimensional emotions** (2 or more occurring at the same time; usually a circumvex)
### (1) **What is an emotion?** The parameters used to study emotion, and the component approach. 

### (2) **What causes emotions?** Major theories about how they unfurl.
Functionalist perspective -- emotions are functional and constitute solutions to environmental changes.
- **Evolutionary Theories**
	- Based on the notion that emotions are biologically based and serve an <mark class="hltr-grey">evolutionary function</mark> to provide advantages for survival
	- Not interested in using emotional expression to support this theory
	- Darwin argued for a <mark class="hltr-grey">communicative or signaling function</mark> of facial expression
	- Cosmides & Tooby wrote that the brain uses different mental programs and emotions activate or deactivate some. 
- **Cognitive Appraisal Theories**
	- Physiological representations of emotional significance
	- Schacter & Singer (1962) —> cognition could differentiate emotion (individuals sometimes experience emotion with no known cause).
	- Emotion arises from <mark class="hltr-yellow">processes of evaluation of significant events</mark> -- **appraisal of event determines which discrete emotion is experienced** (depends on the individual)
	- Emotions do not unfold in a hard-wired way -- because it is not a program!! 
- **Social Constructionist Theories**
	- Differs between cultures and social norms
	- an individual cannot experience any given emotion until he has<mark class="hltr-yellow"> learned to interpret situations in terms of the standards and moral imperatives endorsed by the culture that are relevant to that emotion.</mark>
### (3) **How are emotions understood?** Discrete versus dimensional accounts. Three major theories about the relationship between PA and NA. 
- **Theories**
	- **Fredrickson**:<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> Broaden and Build</mark> -- for self
		- Positive emotions lead to a <mark class="hltr-grey">building of physical and psychological resources</mark>
		- Builds muscular and vascular fitness
		- Allows for practice of skills such as danger negotiation and social confrontation
		- Fosters exploration
		- Help build relationships with others -- involve norms and reciprocity
		- PA help <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"undo" negative emotions</mark>
	- **Shiota**: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Social Constructionist Model</mark> -- for relationships -- **construct social relationships!!!** 
		- Positive emotions are important for romantic relationships; due to desire leading to flirting behavior, display of affection, love and compassion helps maintain relationships
		- Needs to be generally mostly positive
		- <mark class="hltr-yellow">Reciprocation</mark>
- **Positive Affectivity
	- relatively poorly differentiated
	- lack of interest and research
- **Negative Affectivity**
### (4) **Why/how are emotions important or functional** (intrapersonal, dyadic, in a group)? 
- Emotions are used to communicate; helps anticipate behavior and understand why -- appears to be innate
- **Intrapersonal**
	- emotions motivate adaptive action and facilitate adjustment to environmental demands
	- Emotions coordinate the brain's different functional "programs"
- **Dyad**
	- communicates love/attraction: postural/facial/vocal expression changes which bring reciprocal hormonal and behavioral effect
	- communicates dominance
	- elicit <mark class="hltr-yellow">complementary emotions</mark> (reciprocal/responsive)
- **Group**
	- vital to social coordination and helps create bonds to define boundaries
	- helps define hierarchy of the group

### (5) **Levenson's 1999 Core-Control System**
Emotion regulation is a <mark class="hltr-grey">lifelong process</mark> of working out an etiquette of action and interaction between the two emotion systems... let the core system sufficiently free reign so that it can serve its<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> basic adaptive functions</mark>, while maintaining sufficient controls so as to minimize the potential negative effects that unrestrained emotions can have on the individual and on others.
- 2 system model
	1. Input goes into the core system
	2. **Core** -- older, primitive and usually fail-safe
		- autonomic
	3. **Control** -- responds to situation and core system, based on the core system's reaction
		- highly flexible and sensitive to learning 
		- **fine-tuning the operation throughout the lifespan** -- what emotions we express now
		1. Alters the **input** by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">altering the conditions</mark> (how we appraise a situation)
			- reduces emotional behavior and felt emotion with little physiological cost
		2. Alters the **output** by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">intercepting tendencies to response to prototypic situations in characteristic ways; modulates the translation of response tendencies to resulting behavior</mark>
			- reduces emotional behavior but doesn't change felt emotion -- physiological cost
### (6) **Emotion elicitation**. Pros, cons, and unique nature of each method (movies, slides, music, social psychological, etc.) - both in research and in the real world. 
- **Movies** 
	- film images are an illusion of reality and represent a dynamic display of prototypic situations relevant to well-being and survival --> high in ecological validity. 
	- films are naturalistic and more generalizable 
	- **(1) proximity of activation and measurement periods** 
		- emotions take time to show up -- delay may cause altered responses
		- likely to be distorted by errors or systematic biases in recall (Levenson 1988)
		- to avoid this, they use continuous measures of emotion experience
		- **the act of repeated measurement can potentially alter the emotional response itself**
	- **(2) extraction of emotions**
		- films have low temporal resolution and typically create heterogeneous epoch of data
- **Slides**
	- International Affective Picture System (IAPS) -- over 1,000 pictures 
	- quite reliable, easy to control physical parameters such as image size, brightness, color, duration, complexity
- Music
- **Social Psychological**
	- cover story to mask deception and designed to create realistic, emotion-inducing situations, often highly emotional 
	- involves manipulation -- quite difficult 
	- Extremely realistic, avoids demand characteristics, potent, targets discrete emotions that are difficult to elicit

### (7) **How do people communicate emotions?** Relatedly, how are emotions in other measured (behaviorally, autonomically, neurally, via self-report)?
- Communication
	- Verbally (words, tone, volume)
	- Facial Expression
	- Bodily Cues
	- **Affect Research**
		- real life inductions
		- reading affective statements
		- directed facial expressions
		- imagery
- Major and most widely used measures
	- Mood Adjective Checklist (MACL)
	- Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist (MAACL)
	- Profile of Mood States (POMS)
	- **Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X)**
		- Orthogonally related 
		- Two scales of (not positive -- positive; not negative -- negative)
		- Excellent internal consistency and discriminant validity
	- Differential Emotions Scale (DES)
	- **Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM)**
		- ![[Pasted image 20231015185019.png]]
### (8) What strategies do people use to regulate/control their emotions? Which strategies are most effective, and why? 
- **Response Systems**
	- **Experiential** -- emotional valence or discrete emotions
	- **Behavioral** -- facial expression, postural changes, behavioral movements
	- **Physiological**
		- Sympathetic nervous system
		- Parasympathetic nervous system
- Different kinds of strategies include:
	- **Antecedent** (stimulus-focused) strategies -- similar to control system
		- **Reappraisal** -- <mark class="hltr-yellow">alters the trajectory</mark> of all three response systems (above)
		- Situation selection
		- Situation modification
		- Attentional deployment
		- Cognitive change
	- **Response-focused** strategies
		**- Suppression** -- reduces behavioral expression; produces no change in emotional experience; no change in autonomic arousal
			typically associated with greater sympathetic arousal (Gross & Levenson 1997) --> suppression decreases amusement but not sadness
		- Exaggeration
- Results
	- **High Suppression** results in<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> lower PA, less NA expression but same or more NA</mark>
		- high cognitive cost
		- continuous - 전부 다 경험하고 느끼는데 당현이 그렇치 
		- lower memory 
	- **High Reappraisal** results in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">lower NA, higher PA </mark>
		- less cognitively costly
		- initiated early and diffuses the emotional experience
- Controlled vs Automatic
	- **Controlled** -- requires attentional resources, driven by explicit goals (Mauss & Gross)
	- **Automatic** -- initiated by simple registration of sensory inputs, knowledge structures (schema, scripts), shape functions 
		- can become maladaptive and unable to recognize negative emotions
