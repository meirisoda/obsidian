# Blood Type Diet
### What's involved with following this diet? 

### Who is it for? 
For people who want to avoid searching external sources of health benefits. But also everyone! 
### Is it backed by scientific research? 
Not really, because this is based off a naturopathic perspective on health, which is the notion that the body heals itself instead of turning to external sources first. 
However, it may have some evolutionary evidence (see type O diet, it is the original "ancestral" blood type of the earliest humans, hence why the diet is high in animal protein. Type A blood evolved aorund the time when humans started to farm, which leads to a more vegetarian diet.)
However, overall there isn't enough substantial evidence about the benefits of this diet. 
### Is it dangerous? 
It isn't necessarily dangerous. 
### Would you recommend? 
I wouldn't necessarily recommend either, it does sound like it has some benefits but it's not a scientifically valid diet to be superior to others or to be recommended.
