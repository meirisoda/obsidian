# Keto Diet
### What's involved with following this diet? 
High fat, low carbohydrate diet for the body to switch from glucose to ketone bodies as a main souce of energy. It aims to reduce glucose levels in the body. Currently it serves to promote wieght loss, improve mental state and improve metabolic health. 
Have carbohydrates to make up 5-10% of diet (about 20 to 50 grams per day)
Avoid high carb foods and consume foods that are high in fat. It should be followed from 2-3 weeks to 6-12 months. 
### Who is it for? 
Recommended for those who ahve type 2 diabetes, have heart disease and are obese. It is avoided by individuals who have liver or kidney diseases or are pregnant. 
### Is it backed by scientific research? 
It is loosely backed by scientific research - the body uses fat (converted to ketones inthe liver) instead of carbs as an energy source. However, it is not guaranteed that the body will burn the fat during ketosis. 
### Is it dangerous? 
It may not be healthy for pregnant women, those with risk factors for health disease and other medical conditions. 
It will cause a deficiency of both macro and micronutrients. (Due to restricted whole grains, beans, fruits and starchy vegetables, as well as dairy.) Deficiencies in vitamins A, E, K, calcium , magnesium, iron, potassium, linolenic acids, and all water-soluble vitamins excluding vitamin B12. Fiber deficiencies are also a symptom. 
Calcium deficiency is common from a lack of dairy products and may cause fatigue, muscle pain, cognitive issues and tinging in the extremities.
### Would you recommend? 
I would not personally recommend the keto diet as it is an extremely unbalanced diet and is not sustainable long-term.
