# Low Carb Diet
### What's involved with following this diet? 
Restrict carbohydrate intake and emphasizes high protein and high fat foods. 
There are different variations but typically follow either:
Flexible - 100-150g/day
Moderate: 50-100g/day
Strict: 0-50g/day
Focus on high quality carbs even if you eat it. Limit grains, starchy, vegetables and fruit. 
### Who is it for? 
For people who want to lose weight, and improve specific health markers. Not recommended for pregant individuals and athletes. 
### Is it backed by scientific research? 
Scientific research supporting this diet are mostly focused around ketosis. There is some evidence that fat may be oxidized, thus losing fat, but again, this evidence and results are not exclusive to the low carb diet. 
### Is it dangerous? 
May cause some neurological and cognitive symptoms due to lack of energy stores able to be used by the brain. 
### Would you recommend? 
I would not recommend this diet because it is not sustainable long-term. Although it may provide some health benefits, it is not enough
