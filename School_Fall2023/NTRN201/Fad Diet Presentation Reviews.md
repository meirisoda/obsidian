# Low Carb Diet
### What's involved with following this diet? 

### Who is it for? 

### Is it backed by scientific research? 

### Is it dangerous? 

### Would you recommend? 
I would not recommend this diet. It is very unbalanced and even though it is short-term, there are many people who follow it long-term to maintain the results gained from the juice cleanse. It also causes a very unheathy relationship with food.
