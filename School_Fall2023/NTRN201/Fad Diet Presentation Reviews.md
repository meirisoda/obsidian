# Blood Type Diet
### What's involved with following this diet? 
The premise is that certain blood types have foods that they can digest and absorb better. 
Type A: seafood and plant based diet, avoid red meet. If you want to lose weight, avoid dairy, wheat, corn and kidney beans. 
Type B: diverse diet including meat, fruit, dairy, seafood and grains. Avoid chicken, corn, buckwheat and kidney beans. 
Type AB: a balanced diet including animal proteins. Avoid chicken, corn, buckwheat and kidney beans. 
Type O: low carb, high protein diet. Avoid grains, beans and legumes, corn, wheat and dairy. 
### Who is it for? 
For people who want to avoid searching external sources of health benefits. But also everyone! 
### Is it backed by scientific research? 
Not really, because this is based off a naturopathic perspective on health, which is the notion that the body heals itself instead of turning to external sources first. 
However, it may have some evolutionary evidence (see type O diet, it is the original "ancestral" blood type of the earliest humans, hence why the diet is high in animal protein. Type A blood evolved aorund the time when humans started to farm, which leads to a more vegetarian diet.)
### Is it dangerous?
