# Nutrition
The science that links food and diet to health and disease; includes digestion, absorption, metabolism, transportation and excretion of substances
### <mark class="hltr-yellow">Nutritional Status</mark>
determined by 
**Anthropometric measurements** such as height, weight, circumferences
**Biochemical measurements** such as the function of nutrition
**Clinical examination** includes diseases, PMH/PSH, EENT, neuro status etc. 
**Dietary analysis**
**Economic evaluation** 
### Malnutrition
includes overnutrition and undernutrition. 
**Obesity** is the clinical presentation of increased adipose tissue and internal fat relative to body weight
**Overweight** is high body weight relative to height 
### Other Terms
**Hunger** is the physiological drive to eat food in order to fulfill bodily needs.
**Appetite** is the psychological drive to eat food. Can be influenced by a number of things. 
**Satiety** is the physiological state of satisfaction, regulated by the brain. 
**Nutrient Density** refers to amount of nutrients relative to amount
**Energy Density** (kcals)

### Veganism
Nutrient concerns include vitamin B12, iron, zinc, calcium, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D
### Daily Reference Intakes
**Daily Value** -  the recommended amount of intake for Americans; based off a 2000kcal diet
**Recommended Daily Allowances** - the amount of kcals needed to meet nutrient requirements of nearly all healthy individuals. 
**Adequate Intake** - estimated intake value based off estimates of a group of healthy people. 
~~ in relation to the **Standard American Diet**, the SAD has high animal protein intake, high fat and sugars, not enough fiber and refined grains. 
# Nutrients
## Carbohydrates
**4kcal/g** -- provide energy for metabolism
### Monosaccharides
simple sugars 
1. **glucose** - found in table sugar; essential for the bloodstream
2. **fructose** - found in fruits, honey; <mark class="hltr-yellow">converted to glucose in the liver</mark>
3. **galactose**
### Disaccharides
1. **sucrose** - glucose + fructose
2. **lactose** <mark class="hltr-yellow">- galactose + glucose</mark>
3. **maltose** - glucose + glucose
### Polysaccharides
1. **Starches** 
	1. amylose (straight)
	2. amylopectin (branched)
2. **Fiber** (recommended DI is 25g/day for women, 38g/day for men)
	1. **Soluble** - found in soft parts ~~ <mark class="hltr-yellow">slows digestion, reduces cholesterol and CHD, helps produce bile</mark>
	2. **Insoluble** - cellulose ~~ bulks up stool 
	3. **Functional Fibers** are added fibers that can usually serve as a prebiotic
3. **Glycogen**
	1. highly branched polysaccharide
	2. the stored form of carbohydrates for animals and humans in the **liver and muscles**
## Proteins 
**4kcal/g** -- regulates and maintains bodily functions; **provides the essential form of nitrogen**
**RDA is 0.8g/kg** (Grains contain 2-3g/serving; vegetables 2-3g/serving; fruits < 1g/serving; dairy 8-10g/serving)
### Amino Acids
The building blocks of proteins; linked by peptide bonds; form determines function
**9 essential amino acids** (meaning our body cannot produce it naturally and must be taken in through the diet)
<mark class="hltr-yellow">If a diet is deficient in calories or one of the essential amino acids, protein synthesis will be limited</mark>
**11 nonessential amino acids** 
**Branched-Chain Amino Acids** (BCAA's) -<mark class="hltr-green"> Leucine, isoleucine, and valine</mark>
	used by muscles for their energy needs
	found in meat, dairy products and legumes
### Dietary Proteins
**Complete** means that all <mark class="hltr-green">9 essential amino acids</mark> are found in the food; usually only animal proteins, but soy is the only plant-based protein source that is complete.
**Incomplete** means that it is lacking in one or more essential amino acids.
**Complementary proteins** are two or more proteins that can make up for lacking essential amino acids. 
### Protein Deficiencies
**Kwashiorkor** -- severe protein deficit
	S/S include edema, distended belly, fatty liver, rapid onset
**Marasmus** -- severe protein and energy deficit
	S/S include severe weight loss, gradual development]
## Fats/Lipids
**9kcal/g** -- most efficient storage of energy; insulate and protect the body; aid with transport; cholesterol
### Phospholipids
lipid bilayer in cell membranes
### Triglycerides
**Saturated** - solid fats
**Unsaturated** - oils
	monounsaturated - one double bond (olive oil)
	polyunsaturated - multiple double bonds (omega-3; omega-6)
		- omega-3 is anti-inflammatory (sources: fish, chia seeds, walnuts, flax seeds, fat in milk, meat and eggs of grazing)
### Sterols
cholesterol; precursor to hormones such as testosterone, estrogen; active D hormone 
## Micronutrients
### Vitamins
help with chemical reactions
**Water-soluble vitamins** - B&C
**Fat-soluble vitamins** - ADEK 
### Minerals 
aid in nervous system, water balance, musculoskeletal processes
Major minerals >100mg/d
Trace minerals <100mg/d

# Digestive System
Process by which large ingested molecules are mechanically and chemically broken down, producing basic nutrients that can be absorbed across the wall of the GI tract 
### **Mouth**
1. prepares food for swallowing
2. begin digestion of starch with amylase enzyme 
3. begin digestion of fat with lingual lipase 
### **Esophagus**
1. moves food to stomach using peristalsis 
2. lower esophageal sphincter —> prevent backflow of stomach contents into esophagus 
### **Stomach**
1. holds up to 4 cups 
2. secretes gastric juice containing acid, enzymes and hormones —> mixes food with gastric juice —> converts it to <mark class="hltr-yellow">liquid chyme</mark> (which leaves the stomach 1 tsp at a time)
3. **stomach acid (HCl)**
	1. destroys proteins 
	2. activates<mark class="hltr-yellow"> digestive enzymes - pepsin, gastric lipase</mark>
	3. partially digests dietary protein
	4. assists in calcium absorption
4. secretes intrinsic factor, B12 absorption
### **Small Intestine**
1. Sections
	1. **Duodenum** - first segment and receives juices from pancreas and gallbladder (10inches)
	2. **Jejunum** 
	3. **Ileum** 
2. mixes chyme with bile and pancreatic juice
3. secretes hormones and digestive enzymes
4. Other
	1. **Villi** - fingerlike protrusions that participate in digestion and absorption of food
	2. **Absorptive cells** - intestinal cells that line villi and participate in nutrient absorption
	3. **Microvilli** - extensive folds on mucosal surface of absorptive cells 
5. **Nutrient absorption** - passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion, active absorption, phagocytosis and pinocytosis
- typically absorbs Ca, Mg, Fe, glucose, amino acids, fats, vitamins, water and alcohol
###  **Large Intestine**
1. absorption of Na, K, vitamin K, fatty acids, gases
2. <mark class="hltr-yellow">houses gut bacteria</mark> that keep the GI system healthy and absorbs water and electrolytes such as Na and K+ 
	1. protect against infection by pathogens 
	2. produce antimicrobial substances 
	3. vitamin synthesis
3. **Feces:** some water and undigested fiber, touch connective tissues and bacteria
### **Rectum & Anus**

**Lower esophageal sphincter** - Circular muscle constricts opening of esophagus to stomach
**Chyme** - Mixture of stomach secretions and partially digested food
**Pyloric sphincter** - Ring of smooth muscle between stomach and small intestine
### Accessory Organs
1. **Liver**
    1. releases number of unwanted substances that travel with bile to gallbladder
    2. produces bile to aid fat digestion and absorption
2. **Gallbladder**
    1. attached underneath liver
    2. stores and concentrates bile and releases it to small intestine
3. **Pancreas**
    1. has both endocrine and digestive functions 
    2. secretes pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes and bicarb into small intestine
    3. creates insulin and glucagon
# Alcohol
**7kcal/gram** -- standard drink provides 14g of alcohol
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Alcohol is rapidly absorbed through the GI tract by simple diffusion</mark> (mostly absorbed in the stomach and small intestine). 
People who drink consistently (even in small amounts) experience increases in cortisol release from adrenal glands when not drinking so feel more stress and more anxiety when not drinking
### Possible Benefits
Moderate alcohol intake may reduce stress and anxiety, stimulate appetite and increase dietary intake in elderly, lower the risk of cardiovascular disease (lower LDL, increase HDL, decrease platelet aggregation)
### Excessive Alcohol Intake
causes HTN, stroke, cognitive impairment, suppression of immune system, sleep disturbances, abdominal obesity, nutritional deficiencies
## Metabolism Pathways
### Alcohol dehydrogenase pathway (ADH)
low to moderate intakes -- <mark class="hltr-yellow">stomach and live</mark>r 
<mark class="hltr-yellow">metabolizes about 90% of alcohol</mark>
### Microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS) 
moderate to excessive alcohol intake -- increases with increased intake -- <mark class="hltr-yellow">liver</mark>
	allows for efficient metabolism and greater tolerance
	more alcohol is required to produce the same effects 
### Catalase pathway
Minor contribution to alcohol metabolism --<mark class="hltr-yellow"> liver and other cells</mark>
