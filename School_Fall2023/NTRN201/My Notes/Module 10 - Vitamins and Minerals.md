# Vitamins 
Carbon containing substances needed in small amounts by the body. (Essential: cannot be synthesized by the body.)
-  Body cannot make enough to maintain health.
-  Absence will lead to deficiency that can be cured with replenishment. 
## Fat-Soluble Vitamins
Absorbed and stored with dietary fat (so anything interfering with fat absorption will impair vitamin absorption).
Not readily excreted from the body. 
### Vitamin A
RDA: 900 micrograms (남) 700 micrograms (녀)

**Functions** 
- promote vision, night and color
- promotes growth
- prevents drying of the skin and eyes
- promotes resistance to bacterial infection and overall immune system function.

**Sources**
- Liver
- Fortified milk and breakfast cereals
- Dark leafy greens, sweet potatoes, carrots, cantaloupe, apricots 
- can also be synthesized from plant pigments!! (beta-carotene to vitamin A)

| Deficiency | Toxicity |
| --- | --- |
| Night blindness | Fetal malformations|
| Poor growth | Hair loss and skin changes |
| Dry skin | Bone pain and fractures |
| | **(upper limit is 3000 micrograms)** |
| | <mark class="hltr-yellow">toxicity is frequently observed </mark>  due to supplements| 
### Vitamin D
**Functions** 
- Maintenance of calcium and phosphorus 
- Immune system function
- Cell cycle regulation

**Sources**
- can also be synthesized from skin in sunlight.
### Vitamin E
**Functions** 

**Sources**
- can also be synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan.
### Vitamin K
**Functions** 

**Sources**
- can also be synthesized by the gut bacteria to some extent. 
## Water-Soluble Vitamins
Absorbed primarily in the small intestine. 
Transported to the liver via portal vein & distributed to body tissues, in which later they are stored. 
Particularly susceptible to destruction by heat, light, air exposure, cooking in water and alkalinity. 
Excreted via urine. 
### Vitamin C
### Vitamin B Complex
#### Thiamine
#### Riboflavin
#### Niacin
#### Pantothenic acid
#### Biotin
#### Vitamin B6
Stored in the liver. 
#### Folate (folic acid)
#### Vitamin B12 
Stored in the liver. 
### Choline
# Minerals 
Individual chemical elements; cannot be broken down further.
Essential when you have dietary inadequacies causing physiological or structural abnormalities. 
**Major:** need >100mg per day
**Minor:** need <100mg per day
**Ultratrace:** trace amounts in diet, not essential to human health
#### Absorption
Majority absorbed in small intestine. 
Interacts with fiber: phytic acid and oxalic may decrease some mineral absorption
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Vitamin C increases iron absorption.
Vitamin D increases calcium absorption.</mark>
#### Storage
in the muscle tissue, organs and glands.
