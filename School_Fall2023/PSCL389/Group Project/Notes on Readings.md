## Gratitude
emotion, attitude, moral virtue, habit, personality trait, coping response

derived from the word *gratia* meaning **grace, graciousness or gratefullness** - "have to do with kindness, generousness, gifts, the beauty of giving and receiving, or getting something for nothing". 
Usually stems from the perception of a positive personal outcome, not necessarily deserved or earned, that is due to the actions of another person. 
#### The willingness to recognize the unearned increments of value in one's experience. 
#### An estimate of gain coupled with the judgement that someone else is responsible for that gain

Gratitude is an attribution-dependent state that results from a two-step cognitive process:
1. recognizing that one has obtained a positive outcome
2. recognizing that there is an external source for this positive outcome. 
Question: Is recognition necessarily gratitude?
