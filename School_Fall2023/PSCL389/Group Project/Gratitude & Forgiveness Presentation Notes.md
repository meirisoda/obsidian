## Studies
Interviewed accident victims (11 paraplegic, 18 quadriplegics; 85% response rate) as well as lottery winners (197 major winners; 52% response rate; winning amounts range from 5만 to 1million USD).
88 people who lived in approximately the same areas of the city as the lottery winners. Response rate was 41% with 22 participants total.

**Winners** were informed that the research was a study of lotteries. Was mentioned that other lottery winners because these respondents were keenly aware of their special status.
**Control group** was told that the research was a study of everyday life. Did not mention the lottery winners to avoid instituting an unfavorable comparison for the controls.

#### Study Method
General background questions (age, occupation, race, religion, level of education).
Lottery winners and accident victims were asked several open-ended questions such as:
"Has your lifestyle changed in any way wince you won? How?"
"Do you feel you in any way deserved what happened?"
"Do you ask yourself, 'Why me?' How do you answer?"

General happiness measure:
- How happy are you in your current stage of life?
- How happy were you before winning (lottery)
- How happy were you before the accident (victims)
- How happy were you 6 months ago (control)
- How happy do you expect to be in a couple years?
- How pleasant do you find these activities:
	- Talking with a friend
	- Watching television
	- Eating breakfast
	- Hearing a funny joke
	- Getting a compliment
	- Reading a magazine
	- Buying clothes (only for the lottery winners and control group)

## Findings and Discussion
==read this portion first!! ==
Lottery winners generally reported their lives after lives after winning the lottery to be generally more positive, and accident victims reported their lives to be generally less positive.
Both lottery winners and accident victims found their happiness surrounding mundane events to be less positive compared to the control group.

On a scale of 0-5 (0 the worst thing and 5 the best thing):
Lottery 3.78 and victims 1.28
 it is roughly symmetric around the mean (2.5).

General present happiness ratings between the two groups are similar but have significant differences in reports regarding past and future happiness.
People who purchase lottery tickets may have a degree of dissatisfaction with their lives, which may affect ratings of happiness.
Merely introducing the lottery as a topic may shift the focus of happiness to be relative to the lottery winnings (aka. changed the reference point).

At first, winning the lottery would make other events seem less pleasurable, by contrast. Over time, this event may not seem to have any effect at all due to habituation.


Nostalgia Effect
The accident victims recall their past as being happier than did controls (nostalgia effect) and also report their present as being less happy than their controls. However, the victim rating of present happiness is still above the midpoint of the scale and did not appear to be as unhappy as expected.

## Why is there a difference? 
  
Lottery winners: future > past

Because in contrast to their big winner's life, their past seems unhappy in comparison.

Control: past > future

  

Adaptation theory and social comparison (Brickman & Campbell, 1971;  Thibaut & Kelley, 1959) predicted that the lottery context should cause people to attach less importance to mundane pleasures than the every-life context.
