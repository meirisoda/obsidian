## Studies
Interviewed accident victims (11 paraplegic, 18 quadriplegics; 85% response rate) as well as lottery winners (197 major winners; 52% response rate; winning amounts range from 5만 to 1million USD).

88 people who lived in approximately the same areas of the city as the lottery winners. Response rate was 41% with 22 participants total.

  

Winners were informed that the research was a study of lotteries. Was mentioned that other lottery winners because these respondents were keenly aware of their special status.

Control group was told that the research was a study of everyday life. Did not mention the lottery winners to avoid instituting an unfavorable comparison for the controls.

  

General background questions (age, occupation, race, religion, level of education).

  

Lottery winners and accident victims were asked several open-ended questions such as:

"Has your lifestyle changed in any way wince you won? How?"

"Do you feel you in any way deserved what happened?"

"Do you ask yourself, 'Why me?' How do you answer?"

  

General happiness measure:

- How happy are you in your current stage of life?

- How happy were you before winning (lottery)

- How happy were you before the accident (victims)

- How happy were you 6 months ago (control)

- How happy do you expect to be in a couple years?

- How pleasant do you find these activities:

    - Talking with a friend

    - Watching television

    - Eating breakfast

    - Hearing a funny joke

    - Getting a compliment

    - Reading a magazine

    - Buying clothes (only for the lottery winners and control group)

  

Lottery winners: future > past

    Because in contrast to their big winner's life, their past seems unhappy in comparison.

Control: past > future

  

Adaptation theory and social comparison (Brickman & Campbell, 1971;  Thibaut & Kelley, 1959) predicted that the lottery context should cause people to attach less importance to mundane pleasures than the every-life context.
