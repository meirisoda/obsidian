# Gratitude
emotion, attitude, moral virtue, habit, personality trait, coping response
Typically of positive valence. -- typically interpolated with admiration, respect, trust and regard. 

derived from the word <mark class="hltr-yellow">gratia</mark> meaning grace, graciousness or gratefullness - "have to do with kindness, generousness, gifts, the beauty of giving and receiving, or getting something for nothing". 
Usually stems from the perception of a positive personal outcome, not necessarily deserved or earned, that is due to the actions of another person.

>An estimate of gain coupled with the judgement that someone else is responsible for that gain

Gratitude is an attribution-dependent state that results from a two-step cognitive process:
1. recognizing that one has obtained a positive outcome
2. recognizing that there is an external source for this positive outcome. 
Question: Is recognition necessarily gratitude? 

A grateful response to life circumstances may be an adaptive psychological strategy and an important process by which people positively interpret everyday experiences. 

Being aware of how fortunate you are and what it could have been may increase satisfaction 
	하지만 지금 내 상황에 apply를 하면, 지금 보다 더 안좋을 상황이 잘 상상이 안가니까 고맙기가 힘들다 but that might just be my lack of maturity and inability to recognize gratitude in the smaller things in my life.

## Emmon's Study
Randomly assign participants to different experimental conditions. 
Keep daily or weekly records of positive and negative affect, coping and health behaviours, physical symptoms and overall life appraisals. 

Inducing people to: dwell on the favorable, to appreciate the benefits that others provide, and hence reflect on the benevolence of others.

## The negative aspects of gratitude
To be grateful means to allow oneself to be placed in the position of a recipient - to feel indebted and aware of one's dependence on others. 
Has an obligatory aspect and people are generally expected to repay kindnesses. 

People being aware of the things in their lives to be grateful for might increase their recogniziton of the need to reciprocate, and people may resnet these obligations and even report strong negative feelings towards their benefactors (Elster, 1999). 
### Set-point theory
States they people's long-term levels of happiness are relatively stable and vary only slightly around genetically endowed levels. (Diener & Diener, 1996; Lykken, 1999).
If there are chronic baseline levels of affect, then raising the level of affect might be difficult.            
# Brickman et al.
**Is happiness relative?**
## Adaptation Level Theory 
(Brickman & Campbell, 1971)
People's judgements of current levels of stimulation depend on whether this stimulation exceeds or falls short of the level of stimulation to which their previous history has accustomed them. 
Reasons for why people who have been given more happiness won't necessarily be more happy than those with misfortune: 
#### Contrast
Experiences that are salient or extreme and simultaneously relevant to other experiences serve as heavily weighted inputs for adaptation level (Eiser & Stroebe, 1972; Helson, 1964).
Example: winning a million dollars should be a distinctive event and constitutes an extremely positive comparison point - it should shift adaptation level to that happiness side. 
However, it can also make other experiences less enjoyable in comparison. 
#### Habituation
If all things are judged by the extent to which they depart from a baseline of past experience, gradually even the most positive events will cease to have an impact as they themselves are absorbed into the *new* baseline. Further events are judged based off of that baseline (again, comparison). 
Becoming habituated to this level of happiness means that further pleasures are experienced as less intense and should no longer contribute very much to their general level of happiness.

> Lessens the pleasure found in mundane events and in the long run by a process of habituation that **erodes the impact of good fortune itself**.
## Studies 
### Study 1
#### Sample Group
Interviewed accident victims (11 paraplegic, 18 quadriplegics; 85% response rate) as well as lottery winners (197 major winners; 52% response rate; winning amounts range from 5만 to 1million USD).
#### Controls
88 people who lived in approximately the same areas of the city as the lottery winners. Response rate was 41% with 22 participants total. 
#### Procedure
Letters sent differed between different groups of people: 
Winners were informed that the research was a study of lotteries. Was mentioned that other lottery winners because these respondents were keenly aware of their special status. 
Control group was told that the research was a study of everyday life. Did not mention the lottery winners to avoid instituting an unfavorable comparison for the controls. 
#### Measures
General background questions (age, occupation, race, religion, level of education). 

Lottery winners and accident victims were asked several open-ended quetions such as: 
"Has your lifestyle changed in any way wince you won? How?"
"Do you feel you in any way deserved what happened?"
"Do you ask yourself, 'Why me?' How do you answer?"

They were also asked to rate how much credit or blame they assigned to themselves for their outcome and divide the responsibility among four potentially causal factors: 
themselves, others, the environment and chance. 
Asked to place their accident on a scale of "best and worst things that can happen in your life".

General happiness measure: 
- How happy are you in your current stage of life? 
- How happy were you before winning (lottery)
- How happy were you before the accident (victims)
- How happy were you 6 months ago (control)
- How happy do you expect to be in a couple years?
- How pleasant do you find these activities:
	- Talking with a friend
	- Watching television
	- Eating breakfast
	- Hearing a funny joke
	- Getting a compliment
	- Reading a magazine
	- Buying clothes (only for the lottery winners and control group)
#### Results
Although 64% of the lottery winners gave examples of how their lives have changed from the accident, only 23% were willing to say that their ifestyles in general have changed. Changes were generally positive and included: financial security, increased leisure time, easier retirement and general celebrity status. 

In general, lottery winners rated their winnings as a highly positive event, and paraplegis rated their accident as a highly negative event. (0 worst thing, 5 best thing) -- lottery 3.78 and victims 1.28. 
It is interesting to note that although the difference between the lottery and victim group is large, it is roughly symmetric around the mean (2.5). 

Both winners and accident victims found daily activities less enjoyable than controls, but accident victims' difference between control was not that significant. (Winners were significantly different)

Lottery winners and controls were not significantly different in their ratings of how happy they were now, how happy they were before winning and how happy they expected to be in a couple of years. 
The accident victims recall their past as being happier than did controls (nostalgia effect) and also report their present as being less happy than their controls. However, the victim rating of present happiness is still above the midpoint of the scale and did not appear to be as unhappy as expected. 
### Study 2 
Explanations for the differences in lottery winners and controls:
General tendency for people who buy lottery tickets to find life less pleasurable than people who do not buy lottery tickets. A degree of dissatisfaction could be the reason why people buy lottery tickets. 
Another reason for the differences in lottery winners and the control group could be the way that study 1 was set up - lottery winners were clearly aware of the study's focus on the lottery, whereas controls were only told that the study dealt with everyday life. Merely introducing the lottery as context for the interview may induce people to take lottery winners as a reference group. 
==Adaptation theory== and social comparison (Brickman & Campbell, 1971;  Thibaut & Kelley, 1959) predicted that the lottery context should cause people to attach less importance to mundane pleasures than the every-life context. 
	aka. changed the reference point. 
#### Results
Buyers and nonbuyers were quite similar in their present happiness but there were significant differences in past and future happiness. 
Lottery winners: future > past
	Because in contrast to their big winner's life, their past seems unhappy in comparison. 
Control: past > future 
#### Discussion
Although lottery winners felt good about winning the lottery, they took less pleasure than controls in a variety of ordinary and mundane events. They were not generally happier than the control group. 
Can be attributed to the adaptation level analysis of a single extremely positive event. Winning the lottery reamins vivid enough to contrast with more ordinary events but not enough to evelate general happiness. 
> [!highlight]
> A longitudinal study might be good to determine how adaptation level effects change over time for lottery winners. 

Accident victims seem less supportive of adaptation level theory; they do not take more pleasure in ordinary events and rated themselves significantly less happy in general than the control groups. 
Paraplegics exhibited a strong nostalgia effect, rating their pasts as much happier than the controls. 
#### Alternative Explanations
**Alternatively** (instead of adaptation level theory), it could be explained that the decreased satisfaction of the lottery winners is that good luck in a lottery may actually be more painful than pleasurable. 
Sudden changes or extreme outcomes, even though positive, may be stress inducint (Dohrenwend & Dohrenwent, 1974; Rahe, 1972; Vinokur & Selzer, 1975). Stories such as Faustus, King Midas or the Sorcerer's Apprentice warn us that having out dreams fulfilled can create more problems than are solved. 

However, the dissatisfaction and lowered happiness in lottery winners is not due to the misfortune or negative effects of a great life event (ie. in the sense that winning the lottery was an unpleasant experience or a mixed blessing) - more so that the peak experience with the lottery makes more ordinary joys pale in comparison.
##### Perspective Theory
It is also entirely possible that lottery winners could just have a changed perspective on ordinary events than the actual impact of these important events (cognitive appraisal vs subjective effect). 
The lower pleasure ratings of winners and nostalgia effect of the paraplegics may be due to their contrast with previous extreme experiences *rather* than alterations in their subjective scales. (Their happiness scales and perception remains objective and is just relative) -- going back to adaptation level. 
#### Implications 
Happiness is relative. (wow really)
There is no consistent relationship between economic impovement and increased happiness (Gallup, 1977). 
Sex, race, age, income, education, family life-cycle stage and other demographic classification variables account for very little of variance in general happiness. 

We tend to overestimate the overall magnitude of the positive and negative feelings generated by an event (not ours). Because observers see the momentary elation or despair as more extreme or more enduring than it actually is, we make inferences about the disposition (Jones & Nisbett, 1971). 

On both ends of the spectrum (lottery winners and accident victims), they may feel pressure to reduce socialization and communication to avoid social comparison or having to respond to waht they expect are extremes of happiness or despair. 
It can, in turn, make it harder for people who have experienced such extremes events to re-adapt to their social environment (Coates & Wortman).
