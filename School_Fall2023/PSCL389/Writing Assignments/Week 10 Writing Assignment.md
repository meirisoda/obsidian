# Jamie Lee_Week 10 Writing Assignment 
I want to take this week's writing assignments to talk about my goals. 

I've found these weeks readings to be extremely relevant to where I currently am in life. I am 2 semesters away from graduating from a program that is extremely strict and inflexible, nursing. I came into college unsure of what direction I wanted to go in life and I believed the nursing was a safe route that would ensure stability in the future. But as time would go on, my interests became clearer and clearer. 
I even very recently tweeted about this, I wrote: 
"It's frustrating knowing where you want to be and seeing where you are right now
and not knowing the exact path to get to where you want to be."
"What I want for myself has slowly become clearer over the course of the past couple years, but during those past couple years I am moving further away from that goal because of the path I am currently on. And I regret not using that time to move forward in my vision."
"It just feels like wasted time and I am constantly holding myself back."
"I am slowly rediscovering myself but it's just lost time and I know there is no point in looking back and regretting the things I haven't done - just look forward and see what I can do now but it's just a shame."

Which is extremely timely. I'm at a time in my life where I'm nearing graduation and my post-graduation plans will soon become a reality. But I don't even have a solid diea
