# Discussion Board Questions - 크위즈때 참고

**A perioperative nurse is interviewing a patient pre-op for their surgical procedure. Which question is least pertinent for a pre-op interview?**

1. "Do you have any implants and assistive devices such as ports, pacemaker/ICD, hearing aids, contacts, or dentures?"
2. "Have you, or anyone in your family, ever had an adverse reaction to anesthesia other than nausea and vomiting upon awakening?"
3. "Have you been placed under anesthesia in the last 30 days?"
4. "Have you had anything to eat or drink since midnight last night?"

Answer: 3

Rationale: Implants and assistive devices contain metal in them and can cause a fire in the OR, so they must be either removed or the nurse must notify the surgeon of the device. We must ask patients about their family history of anesthesia because conditions such as malignant hyperthermia, which can be deadly during surgery, are genetic. We must confirm that patients have been NPO prior to the procedure to ensure that they won't aspirate during the procedure. Whether or not they have had anesthesia in the last 30 days is unimportant.

**You are nurse working with the anesthesia team and are tasked with scoring your patient on the ASA scale. During your interview with your patient, Leslie Hall, you learn that she is 34 yo female with Type 1 Diabetic with an A1C of 5.9% (go Leslie!), drinks socially on the weekends, denies smoking, and also has an implanted pacemaker for a chronic heart condition. Based on this information, you determine that Leslie is...?**

1. ASA I
2. ASA II
3. ASA III
4. ASA VI
5. ASA V
6. ASA IV

Answer: C

Rationale: The ASA Classification Scale is a tool that has been used for over 60 years to identify potential perioperative risk. It is a helpful tool that can predict problems as well as estimated mortality rate. Each ASA level has certain criteria. Answer A is incorrect because Leslie has several health conditions and endorses social drinking. Answer B is incorrect because although Leslie has well controlled T1D, drinks only socially, and doesn't smoke, she still has a pacemaker. 
Answer B is an attractive answer as the patient mostly appears in good health. Answer C is correct as having an implanted pacemaker is a sign of a severe systemic disease and a potentially riskier surgery. This is not negated by her overall health in other areas. Answer D is incorrect as the patient does not have a severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life. Answer E is incorrect as the patient is not in acute distress, and Answer D is incorrect as the patient is not brain-dead.

**You are the charge nurse responsible for a complex surgical procedure involving multiple team members. The patient and surgical site is prepped appropriately for surgery. However, during the surgery, a fire breaks out unexpectedly.**

What immediate actions should you take as the charge nurse to address the fire? Select the three most appropriate actions from the following options:

A) Evacuate the patient from the operating room.
B) Use a fire extinguisher to suppress the flames.
C) Call for assistance and activate the fire alarm system.
D) Remove all flammable materials from the surgical field.
E) Apply sterile saline to extinguish the fire on the patient.

Answer: A, B, C

Rationale: Evacuating the patient from the operating room takes priority in order to ensure the safety of the patient. Using a fire extinguisher is used to suppress the flames and to prevent the fire from spreading further. Calling for assistance and activating the fire alarm system are important in order to alert the entire surgical team (including those not present in the operating room) and the hospital's fire response team to quickly address the fire and follow fire protocol.
Removing flammable materials is important but should be done after moving the patient away and suppressing the fire. By removing flammable materials, you pose a risk to yourself as a team member and spreading the fire. Using sterile saline to extinguish the fire on the patient is not recommended; instead, a fire extinguisher or fire blanket should be used.

**A nursing student is asked to discuss information relating to preoperative skin antiseptic. Which statements by the nursing student are accurate? Select all that apply.**

A) Patient should be bathed at least 36 hours before an invasive procedure.

B) If hair removal is necessary, electric clippers should be used instead of a razor.

C) Patient should be instructed to avoid using lotion/powder/deodorant after their preoperative bathe.

D) The main purpose of decolonization is to prevent SSIs.

Answer: B, C, D

Rationale: Patient should shower/bathe at least 24 hours before their procedure. If there need to be hair removed, clippers should be used to reduced the chances of skin injury and therefore, SSI. Lotion/powder/ deodorant should not be used. Decolonization is mainly for the purpose of decreasing the amount of staphylococcus aureus of the skin to prevent bacterial infection to the surgical site.

**The student nurse is assisting the nurse with a pre-operative assessment. As the nurse goes over the medical history the student nurse documents that the patient has a Braden score of 14, no cardiac history, a past surgical history including a cholecystectomy done last year, a history of breast cancer on the maternal side of the family, and diabetes mellitus type 2 that was diagnosed 15 years ago. Which observation would indicate that this patient is at risk for pressure injuries?  Select all that apply.**

A. Family history of breast cancer

B. Braden score of 14

C. preexisting DM ll

D. Surgical history

E. All of the above

Answer: B and C

Although all documented findings are important to know during the pre-operative assessment; preexisting diabetes and a Braden score of 14 are both directly related to the increased risk of acquiring a pressure injury. A Braden score of 14 indicates that the patient is at moderate risk of obtaining a pressure sore due to a lack of mobility, incontinence, limited activity, and a fair diet. Individuals with DM ll suffer from slow wound healing and if the wound is healing slowly it has the chance to get infected and get worse. A family history of breast cancer wouldn't have anything to do with pressure injuries. A surgery from a year ago shouldn't affect the new surgery.

**A nurse is preparing a patient before entering the operating room for a mitral valve replacement. The nurse acknowledges that the patient expresses difficulty lying supine due to the patient's PMH of obesity and respiratory disease. What is the best action from the nurse to help correct the inferior vena cava and reduce hypotension for the patient once in the OR?**

```markdown
1. Leave the patient
2. Administer nasal canula
3. Convince the patient about postponing the surgery
4. Place a towel under the right lower back and hip
```

Answer: 4

Rationale: Common positions found in the operating room could be supine, recumbent, prone, or sitting. Operating tables will consist of attachments and tools that will ensure safety and proper positioning is responsibly placed for the patient to prevent intraoperative injuries both short or long term cases. When the patient is placed in proper positioning it allows easy access to the patient's airway, thus, option 1 does not make sense. Although option 2 may provide additional oxygen supply for the patient, the patient would not experience comfort therefore increasing the risk for complications during and after the procedure. Option 3 is completely disregarding the patient's concern/well being and should not be allowed during any plan of care. The correct option, 4, practices patient safety needed to provide comfort for the patient and their concerns (Yoost. 2020, 876).

**Which of the following in the preoperative process most fundamentally contributes to patient safety?**

a. Thoroughly reviewing the patient's medical history

b. Educating the patient about what to do the day before surgery, including showering, fasting, and avoiding blood thinners

c. Reducing anxiety and asking about psychosocial needs

d. Identifying the patient and confirming the site of surgery

Answer: D

Choice D is the most essential step in the preoperative process that contributes to patient safety. If not done correctly, none of the preoperative process will be effective in treating the patient. Choice C has little to no contribution to patient safety. Choice A and B do play a role in patient safety and patient care but is not the most important step here. Choice D must be the first step done in the preoperative process to guarantee that the right surgical procedure is being done to the right patient.

**A student nurse is currently observing an open hip surgery. They notice it is a bit warm in the operation room and see the resident doctor assisting with the surgery is breaking a sweat. What action should the student nurse take?**

1. Find the A/C and turn it up to increase air flow in the room and lower the temperature.
2. Nothing, it is inappropriate and unprofessional to disrupt a serious procedure.
3. Wait until after the procedure to report the situation to a hospital technician who can fix the room's temperature and humidity level.
4. Tell their instructor or another nurse in the room the resident doctor is sweating and jeopardizing the sterile field of the patient.

Answer: 4

Rationale: The sweating resident doctor can drip onto the patient or into the patient undergoing an open surgery. It can cause infection and will contaminate the sterility of the procedure. Surgical rooms should be between the temperature of 68-75 degrees Fahrenheit and maintain a relative humidity of 20-60%. It is very important that the room is comfortable and everyone is aware of this possible situation so that when it is observed, it can be handled properly and immediately before it harms the patient.

Option 1 is wrong because it is not something the student nurse is responsible for and it does not communicate to the people in the room of the situation. Option 2 is wrong because doing nothing does not solve the problem. Option 3 is wrong because something should be done when it is first observed.

**In lecture this week, we discussed the ASA  physical status classification and how patients are classified accordingly. Based on the information listed below, classify the patient "Lucky"  based on her background history:**

**Lucky is a 34-year-old female who has a PMH of the following: BMI of 23, does not smoke or drink, has poorly controlled HTN because she does not follow her medication regime, has poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes (due to diet), and continues to miss scheduled dialysis appointments.**

Which ASA classification would Lucky fall under?

1. ASA I
2. ASA III
3. ASA IV
4. ASA V

Answer: ASA IV

Rationale: Our patient Lucky will be classified as an ASA IV because of two main components: 1. Lucky does not control her Type 2 Diabetes because she does not attend her dialysis appointments 2. Lucky also does not control her hypertension because she does not stick to her medication regimen. With both of these criteria, she is automatically classified in ASA class IV. Despite Lucky's normal BMI and no past history of smoking and drinking, she does not control her diseases well.

**When performing preoperative patient skin antisepsis, perioperative personnel should do all of the following EXCEPT:**

1. Adhere to the manufacturers IFU when applying skin antiseptic
2. Use the same type of antiseptic on every patient
3. Apply antiseptic to burns, open wounds, and fragile tissues using gentle friction
4. Verify that the antiseptic covers all appropriate surfaces and prevent prolonged skin exposure not directly in the surgical site

Correct answer: 2

Rationale: Patients may have allergies or skin sensitivities that perioperative personnel must review before selecting the proper antiseptic. They should also assess to see if the patient has iodism, along with assessing the surgical site for location, presence of hair, and skin integrity. Additionally, it is important for perioperative personnel to note that neonates are more susceptible to skin irritation, chemical burns, transient hypothyroidism, or iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, so antiseptics may have to be adjusted accordingly.

**Upon admission for an exploratory laparoscopy, a preoperative client provides the nurse with a physical document that outlines instructions their healthcare team should follow if they are unable to verbalize these wishes after the operation.  What is this document called?**

```
Patient's Bill of Rights
Advanced Directive
Informed Consent
Insurance Card

```

Correct Answer: B. Advanced Directive

Rationale: Advanced Directives refers to legal documents that convey instructions for medical care if the patient is unable to communicate these wishes. The Patient's Bill of Rights refers to a list of guarantees for an individual undergoing care such as a right to fair treatment, autonomy, confidentiality, and more. Informed Consent refers to a signed legal document that states the patient understands the proposed procedure and its risk, benefits, and alternatives. An insurance card provides proof of insurance and gives access to care and coverage.

**Which of the following statements made by the patient 24 hours prior to surgery would raise concern and possibly result in the delay of surgery?**

```
“I took aspirin this morning.”
“I am extremely nervous about this surgery. My blood pressure is 145/100mmhg which is higher than usual.”
“I forgot to shave.”
“I bathed in soap instead of an antiseptic.”

```

Answer: 1

Rationale: Choice 1 is correct because blood thinners like aspirin should be stopped prior to surgery to minimize risk of bleeding.  Blood thinners prevent blood from clotting causing very serious bleeding to occur especially during high risk procedures. In general, high blood pressure is not a reason to postpone surgery as long as it stays within the parameters and is controlled. Shaving is not needed unless it is obstructing surgical site view. Shaving can also be done by the nurse. AORN recommends bathing in antiseptic or soap.

**Which is true about properly maintaining a sterile field?**

1. Unscrubbed members should stay at least 6" away from the sterile field and scrub team.
2. Below table level is sterile.
3. Edges of sterile packaging are not sterile.
4. Tape doors to secure the sterile field.

rationale: Answer 3 is the correct answer. When opening a sterile package the one-inch border on the sterile field is considered not sterile because the edges are often touched without sterile gloves when opening the packaging. Answer 1 is incorrect because unscrubbed members should stay at least 12" away from the sterile field, not 6". It is very important to not contaminate the sterile field so all unscrubbed members need to keep their distance from the sterile field. Answer 2 is incorrect because anything below the table/waist level is considered contaminated. That's why it's important for scrubbed members to keep their hands above waist level at all times. Objects that are out of the field of vision are considered contaminated. Answer 4 is incorrect because taping the door is unsafe. In the OR there are often people that come in and out to get additional supplies. It is also important that access in and out is easy in case there is an emergency and additional help is required.

**CASE: A 34-year old man with morbid obesity came in for a drainage of a pilondial abscess with fistulectomy under general anesthesia with endotrachael intubation. The anesthesiologist noted the patient had a Mallampati score of 3, a short thick/ neck, and most likely will have a difficult time being intubated. After they positioned and preoxygenated the patient, what should the anesthesiologist do next?**

1. Use advanced airway equipment video (laryngoscope).
2. Stop the procedure.
3. Anesthesiologist will induce the patient with IV propofol and fentanyl concurrent with a neuromuscular block with IV suxamethonium.
4. Anesthesiologist will use a bigger endotracheal tube for intubation because the patient has a bigger neck.

Rationale: Answer choice 1 is correct. Because this is a high risk patient, advanced airway management should be readily available. The anesthesiologist will use advanced airway equipment to assess the airway to prevent difficult intubation. Impaired ventilation and inadequate brain oxygenation can ultimately lead to brain damage (hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy) only within a few minutes. The patient was identified with a Mallampati score of 3 and has a high risk of for hypoxemia during endotracheal intubation. Even with the thorough anesthesiologist examination, only half of difficult intubations are predicted, therefore you need advanced equipment video to determine the full risk. The advanced airway equipment will allow for less risk of hypoxemia and easier intubation. Answer choice 2 is incorrect because you do not need to stop the procedure. Answer three is partially correct, but before that the anesthesiologist would do that, they use a laryngoscope. And answer 4 is incorrect because you would need to assess the tracheal tube before inserting a bigger size and the patient's neck size is not a determinant of tube size. Bigger trachael tubes will cause harm to the patient if they do not need it, example a sore throat post op. Patients who are obese have a harder time being intubated and also desaturate easily.

**Which intervention is most likely to reduce hypoxia during endotracheal intubation for an obese patient with a mallampti score of 3 with no prior comorbities?**

A. Perform intubation with no concerns since the patient does not have prior comorbities

B.  Use high-flow nasal cannula for preoxygenation

C. Patient should be prone during intubation

D.  Use low-flow nasal cannula for preoxygenation

Correct answer: B

Rationale: The use of a high-flow nasal cannula prolongs the time of desaturation, so the patient's low blood oxygen saturation does not continue to decrease when the patient is intubated. Patient's with obesity desaturate quickly because of their reduced lung capacity. Option A is incorrect because the patient was reported to have a mallampti score of 3, which means that endotracheal intubation may be difficult. Option C is incorrect because the patient should be supine with the head and neck in the ramped position (elevation of head and shoulders) instead of prone. Option D is incorrect because a low-flow is not as efficient as a high-flow nasal cannula to prolong the time of desaturation (Inadequate Anesthia, 2021).

**Info: A 57-year-old female is coming in today for her total hip replacement surgery. Due to her arthritis, the patient has been living a sedentary lifestyle for 15 years now. Her medical history reveals hypertension, but she has not been taking her hypertension meds as she states that she feels fine without them. In addition, the patient stated that she doesn’t smoke or do any illicit drugs. However, she does drink 1-2 glasses of wine every night to help her fall asleep. Two weeks ago, she came in for her H&P. Her BP read 147/103, weight is 85 kg and height is 163cm.**

**Based on the information given to you above, which ASA classification level does she belong in?**

```
ASA II
ASA III
ASA IV
ASA V

```

Answer: 2

Rationale: The patient wouldn’t be in ASA II as her HTN is poorly uncontrolled since she’s not taking her HTN meds (Committee on Economics). She also has some alcohol dependence as she drinks every night to help with her insomnia making her classified in ASA III (Committee on Economics). Other evidence includes her being morbidly obese (Committee on Economics). Because she doesn’t have any abnormal heart issues that put her life at risk, option 3 would not be correct (Committee on Economics). Option 4 is not correct, as she is not having an emergent or urgent surgery (Committee on Economics).

**A perioperative client has a scheduled surgery with a high Silverstein Fire Risk Score. The location of the surgery is taking place above the xiphoid process, uses open O2 delivery, and has the presence of an ignition that causes surgical smoke. What are the safety practices you can take to protect yourself and the patient against surgical smoke?**

```
Having safe evacuation systems
Having respiratory protection
Having smoke evacuation programs
All of the above

```

Answer: 4

Rationale: Surgical smoke is known to cause various health hazards that affect both the perioperative patient and the healthcare team. It can affect us, chemically, biologically, carcinogenically, mutagenically, cytotoxically, and/or through our respiratory system. The safety practices used to combat these hazards are smoke evacuation systems, respiratory protection, and a smoke evacuation program. The first line of protection is evacuation systems that work in combination with room ventilators to clean the air of hazardous elements in the air. The secondary protection used is proper respiratory protection like a fitted N95 with a filtering facepiece respirator. This helps fight against any residual smoke created in surgery. Having a smoke evacuation program implemented is an evidence-based strategy to achieve routine compliance to maintain the OR a smoke-free environment.

**Which of the following is a high risk factor for hypoxemia during endotracheal intubation?**

1. Age
2. Sex
3. Ethnicity
4. Morbid obesity

Answer: 4

Rationale: During the preoperative period, it is important to identify factors that will not prevent the patient from receiving adequate oxygenation and ventilation during their surgical procedure. If an individual does not receive the necessary anesthesia for their surgery due to impaired ventilation and inadequate brain oxygenation, it can lead to brain damage within a few minutes. An accurate preoperative airway assessment is very important in preventing any complications. The preoperative airway assessment will identify factors that could potentially create problems. Factors such as morbid obesity are high-risk factors for hypoxemia during intubation.

**A patient is scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia tomorrow. When gathering preoperative data, the nurse notes that the patient had a fluid intake of 500mL, has a BMI of 32.0, uses a CPAP, and experiences SOB when exercising. With this data, what should the nurse be most concerned about?**

```
Post-op ambulation
Difficult intubation and hypoxia
Fluid intake will affect the surgery
Blood loss during the surgery

```

Answer: 2

Rationale:

A high BMI indicates obesity, CPAP is used for patients with sleep apnea, and SOB (shortness of breath) are all risk factors for difficult intubation and hypoxia during surgery. This information is crucial because impaired airways and insufficient oxygen can lead to severe brain damage, which can be subject to anesthesia malpractice claims. Inadequate preparation and examination will cause a higher risk of the patient suffering from impaired airways. 1 is about post-op and not a priority to think about now. 3 is incorrect because NPO starts at midnight the day before the surgery. 4 is a concern, but it could be applied to any patient, and not specific enough for this situation.

**A nurse is preparing the patient for a colonoscopy . What kind of anathema does the nurse anticipate the patient will get?**

A) conscious sedation

B) spinal anesthesia

C) epidural anesthesia

D) nerve block

correct answer: A

rationale: patient does not need to be under a deep state of sedation, paralysis, or sleep for this procedure

**Jill the scrub tech is heating up during the procedure and notices she is sweaty. As she goes to grab a hemostat for the surgeon, a small drop of sweat lands right on the sterile field. What is the best/most prioritized action after this occurs?**

A. Jill should not say anything and let the procedure continue.

B. Jill should document the incident in the postoperative report.

C. Jill should blot the sweat with gauze and avoid putting surgical instruments on the sweat spot.

D. Jill should notify the surgeon and take immediate corrective action.

Rationale: Answer- D

D is the correct answer because sweat is not sterile and it is a contaminant. If sweat does drop onto a sterile field, the procedure must be stopped and corrective measures must be taken to set up a new sterile field. If any part of the sterile field is compromised immediate action needs to be taken by determining the appropriate course of action to maintain asepsis. Taking immediate corrective action may involve reestablishing the sterile field, removing and replacing contaminated instruments, and discussing any potential contamination risks. Patient safety and infection prevention are of utmost priority in the OR. Option A is incorrect because of letting the procedure continue, as the field is contaminated it leaves the risk of infection for the patient.  B is correct, but is not the first point of action required in this situation. C is incorrect because sweat is a contaminant and blotting it and leaving it there along with not telling anybody, puts the patient at risk for infection.

**A nursing student is shadowing a nurse in the OR. The case is a laryngectomy of a 75 year old man with PMH of cancer, COPD, hypertension, and generalized edema. The patient is allergic to penicillin. The patient requires 1L of O2 due to his COPD. The nurse shows the student how to prep the patient's neck with CHG. The surgeon plans to use a Bovie throughout the procedure. The nursing student knows that which of the following details about the case are a risk for surgical fire (select all that apply)?**

A. Location of surgery

B. CHG skin prep

C. Penicillin allergy

D. Oxygen administration

E. Cautery

Answer: A, B, D, E

Rationale:

```
A: Correct; The location of the surgery (laryngectomy) is above the xiphoid process, indicating a greater risk of surgical fire.
B: Correct; CHG skin prep contains alcohol, which could act as fuel for a fire if it is not properly dried. The nurse should follow the product manufactures instructions on drying time and clean up excess prep before draping.
C: Incorrect; Penicillin allergy is not related to surgical fire risks.
D: Correct; Oxygen is an oxidizing agent that increases the chances of a fire if not carefully monitored. The nurse and anesthesiologist should carefully monitor the gas exchange throughout the surgery and use the lowest flow O2 flow rate possible. Any increase in O2 concentration also increases the risk of a fire.
E: Correct; Cautery could be an ignition source for a surgical fire if not handled correctly. The surgeon should use the cautery tools with caution. The scrub tech/nurse should ensure correct storage of the device in a holster when it's not being used. The cautery machine should not be placed near an oxidizer source.

**After providing correct patient education, the pre-operative nurse asks the patient to explain what he learned about general anesthesia. Which of the following shows that the patient requires further education?**

```
I need to be assessed for clear airway and breathing before my surgery
My grandfather died from MH but that's not relevant to my upcoming surgery
I can’t eat or 4-6 hours prior to my surgery
I need to check for a family history of MH

```

The answer is 2

Malignant Hypothermia is a genetic disorder passed down through generations. If the patient knows that a family member has a history with MH it is crucial that they let the nurse know so that they can implement necessary precautions. Breathing and airway always needs to be assessed but especially before surgery. It is correct that you cannot eat 4-6 hours prior to surgery.

**A bovie was placed down improperly and a fire has broken out on the drapes while the patient is undergoing surgery. What is the primary action in this case?**

A. Turn off the bovie

B. Pour saline on hot spots

C. Get rid of drapes and burning materials

D. Turn off oxygen sources in the room

Answer: A

Rationale: in the case of a surgical fire, the priority action should always be to turn off the source of the fire, in order to prevent the fire from continuing to burn. If the burning materials are contained but the source is not, the fire will continue to burn other objects. Pouring saline and hot spots and getting rid of drapes and burning materials should be done after the source of the fire is contained. Oxygen is one of the points on the fire triangle so it would be a priority to reduce oxygen flow, but it is not the first priority since oxygen is not the source of the fire.

**A nurse is sending a patient to the operation for their surgery when she realizes that they patient did not sign the informed consent form. The lazy doctor tells her to obtain the patient's signature before the proceed with the surgery. What should the nurse do next?**

A. The doctor told her, "I give you permission to get the patient's informed consent". So, the nurse decides to obtain the informed consent.

B. Watch the patient sign the informed consent.

C. Tell the doctor that it is not her duty to obtain the patient's signature.

D. Ask anesthesia to obtain the patient's signature for the informed consent.

Answer: C

The onboarding checklist before the surgery is to obtain an informed consent from the patient. However, this is not the responsibility of a nurse to do so. It is the doctor/physician's responsibility to teach the patient in regards to his/her condition and the process or options of treatment. Nurses are not able to obtain informed consent, however, witness and also document that the patient has signed the informed consent.

**Question: Which of these patients would have the highest ASA classification.**

1. A 33 year old female with no significant past medical or surgical history, and denies any drug use
2. A 68 year old male who has a ruptured thoracic aneurysm
3. An 87 year old male with uncontrolled COPD and a history of a TIA at 60 years old
4. A 40 year old female who is a current smoker (1 pack a week), and has well controlled DM2.

Answer: 2
Rationale: This patient's diagnosis is considered life threatening and will not survive without the operation, this would qualify the patient to be considered a level 5.

**A nurse is preparing an overweight patient who is undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The patient has a past medical history (PMH) of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. With the patient receiving general anesthesia, the patient is at risk for pressure injuries (PIs). What is the best action from the nurse to prevent these pressure injuries?**

A. Make sure the patient's weight is evenly distributed along the mattress.

B. Use supporting aids such as pillows on areas PIs occur.

C. Place the patient on the side of the PI.

D. There is nothing that for the patient to prevent PIs during surgery.

Answer: B

Rationale: Answer A is incorrect because it is not the best action. Distributing the patient's weight does help prevent PIs; however, adding extra cushioning on areas that PIs most likely appear like the sacrum can help prevent PIs. Answer B is correct because as previously stated, adding additional support for the patient can help prevent PIs. Answer C is incorrect because you should avoid positioning patients directly on an existing PI or body surface that remains damaged or erythematous when possible. Answer D is incorrect because there are ways to prevent PIs like having the correct operating mattress, supporting aids, and moving patient during surgery if possible.

**Preoperative evaluation yields an improved relationship between anesthesiologist and patient and reduces:**

1. Time of anesthetic administration
2. Anesthetic complications
3. Family concern of anesthesia
4. Total time to complete operation

Answer: 2

Rationale: Anesthetic complications are reduced as a result of preoperative evaluations since proper risk assessment is able to be completed and potentially catch factors or other unknown conditions that may result in complications associated with anesthesia prior to surgery.

**A patient is scheduled for surgery, and the anesthesiologist has assigned an ASA classification to assess their overall health status. Which of the following ASA classes describes a patient with well-controlled hypertension and mild obesity, who has a minimal risk of complications during surgery or anesthesia?**

A. ASA CLASS 1

B. ASA CLASS 2

C. ASA CLASS 3

D. ASA CLASS 4

answer: A; ASA class 1

rationale: ASA class 1 refers to a patient who is healthy with no systemic diseases. They also have minimal risk during surgery. Meanwhile, ASA class 2 describes a patient who has mild systemic diseases, but controlled and the risk of complications is slightly higher. ASA class 3 is assigned to a patient who has severe systemic diseases with less control of them. ASA class 4 refers to a patient who has life threatening conditions. There are 2 more classes of ASA as well including ASA 5 and 6. ASA 5 describes a patient who cannot live without surgery and require life aving measure and ASA 6 describes a patient who is brain dead.
