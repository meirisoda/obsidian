The alkaline diet is a diet (or group of diets) based off the belief that our diet can alter the pH of our body. It originates from the acid ash hypothesis 
### What is the acid ash hypothesis? 
It originates from the acid ash hypothesis, which states that when your body metabolizes and breaks down food, the food can leave behind metabolic waste, known as ash. 
#### Acidic Ash
If the food leaves behind acidic ash, it makes your blood more acidic. If you eat foods that leave behind alkaline ash, it makes your blood more alkaline. 

According to this hypothesis, acidic ash leaves you more vulnerable to illness while alkaline ash is considered to have healing and protective properties. 

Foods that leave behind acidic ash and should be avoided are: meat, poultry, eggs, cheese, fish and grains. 
#### Alkaline Ash 
Alkaline ash is produced by fruits and vegetables (with the exception of cranberries, prunes and plums). 
Alkaline water is another component of this group of diets. 
### Health Claims
As you can probably deduce, this diet and belief falls more closely under alternative medicine rather than a pure diet. 
The notion of alkaline ash being more beneficial to the human body originates from osteoporosis research. The idea is that with excessive acid intake or a shift in bodily pH to a more acidic side, is that the kidneys (that try to filter it all out and maintain bodily pH levels) will use the bone's alkaline mineral reserves to balance it out. 
Causing our bones to become weaker. 
So the idea is by consuming higher alkaline foods that you increase the amount of alkaline mineral reserves in the body to give your bones strength and maintain a reserve for pH regulation in the case of acid imbalance. 

The diet claims to prevent osteoporosis, heart disease, treat low energy levels, and cure cancer. 

Although some of the beliefs may have originated from scientific research and may have some validity, it is largely not recommended by dieticians and medical professionals.
