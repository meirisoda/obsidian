- Body organized into cells - tissues - organs - systems 
- Requires energy from CHO (carbohydrates), fats, protein for cell turnover, water, protein and minerals, vitamins and oxygen. 

## Digestive System
Performs mechanical and chemical digestion, absorption of nutrients, elimination of wastes - houses bulk of the immune system. 
	**Digestion:** process by which large ingested molecules are mechanically and chemically broken down, producing basic nutrients that can be absorbed across the wall of the GI tract

### Gastrointestinal tract
Sites in the body for digestion and absorption of nutrients; consists of
1. **Mouth**
    1. prepares food for swallowing
    2. begin digestion of starch with amylase enzyme 
    3. begin digestion of fat with lingual lipase 
2. **Esophagus**
    1. moves food to stomach using peristalsis 
    2. lower esophageal sphincter —> prevent backflow of stomach contents into esophagus 
3. **Stomach**
    1. Typically absorbs: water (20%), water (small amount) 
    2. holds up to 4 cups 
    3. secretes gastric juice containing acid, enzymes and hormones —> mixes food with gastric juice —> converts it to liquid chyme (which leaves the stomach 1 tsp at a time)
    4. **stomach acid (HCl)**
        1. destroys proteins 
        2. activates digestive enzymes - pepsin, gastric lipase
        3. partially digests dietary protein
        4. assists in calcium absorption
    5. secretes intrinsic factor, B12 absorption
4. **Small Intestine**
    1. Sections
        1. **Duodenum** - first segment and receives juices from pancreas and gallbladder (10inches)
        2. **Jejunum** - middle (4feet)
        3. **Ileum** - last (5feet) 
    2. mixes chyme with bile and pancreatic juice
    3. secretes hormones and digestive enzymes
    4. Other
        1. **Villi** - fingerlike protrusions that participate in digestion and absorption of food
        2. **Absorptive cells** - intestinal cells that line villi and participate in nutrient absoprtion
        3. **Microvilli** - extensive folds on mucosal surface of absorptive cells 
    5. Nutrient absorption
        1. Typically absorbs: Ca, Mg, Fe, glucose, amino acids, fats, vitamins, water (70-90%), alcohol (80%)
        2. **Passive diffusion:** diffusion of nutrients across absorptive cell membranes
        3. **Facilitated diffusion:** uses a carrier protein to move nutrients down a gradient
        4. **Active absorption:** involves a carrier protein to move against gradient
        5. **Phagocytosis and pinocytosis** 
5. **Large Intestine**
    1. absorption of Na, K, vitamin K, fatty acids, gases
    2. houses gut bacteria that keep the GI system healthy and absorbs water and electrolytes such as Na and K+ 
        1. protect against infection by pathogens 
        2. produce antimicrobial substances 
        3. vitamin synthesis
    3. **Feces:** some water and undigested fiber, touch connective tissues and bacteria
6. **Rectum & Anus**

**Lower esophageal sphincter** - Circular muscle constricts opening of esophagus to stomach
**Chyme** - Mixture of stomach secretions and partially digested food
**Pyloric sphincter** - Ring of smooth muscle between stomach and small intestine

### Accessory Organs
1. **Liver**
    1. releases number of unwanted substances that travel with bile to gallbladder
    2. produces bile to aid fat digestion and absorption
2. **Gallbladder**
    1. attached underneath liver
    2. stores and concentrates bile and releases it to small intestine
3. **Pancreas**
    1. has both endocrine and digestive functions 
    2. secretes pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes and bicarb into small intestine
    3. creates insulin and glucagon

### Hepatic Portal Circulation

Part of cardiovascular system — portal vein carries nutrient rich blood from intestines and portions of stomach to liver

### Gut Bacteria
**Probiotics:** live microorganisms that provide health benefits 
**Prebiotics:** non-digestible food ingredients that promote growth of bacteria; feed probiotics; inulinand resistant starch
### Nutritional Genomics
**Nutrigenetics:** effects of genes on nutritional health
**Nutrigenomics:** food impacts health through its interaction with our genes and its subsequent effect on gene expression 
### Hormones and Secretions

| Hormone | Released by | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ghrelin | stomach | increases appetite and food intake |
| Gastrin | stomach and duodenum in response to food arriving |  tells stomach to release HCl and pepsinogen; stimulates gastric and intestinal motility |
| Cholecystokinin | small intestine in response to dietary fat in chyme | stimulates release of pancreatic enzymes and bile from gallbladder  |
| Secretin | small intestine in response to acidic chyme | stimulates release of pancreatic bicarbonate |
| Motilin |  small intestine in response to gastric distention and dietary fat | regulates motility of gastrointestinal tract |
| Glucose-dependent insulinotriopic peptide (GIP) | small intestine in response to glucose, amino acids and fat | inhibits gastric acid secretion and stimulates insulin release |
| Peptide YY  | ileum and large intestine in response to fat in the large intestine | inhibits gastric and pancreatic secretions |
| Somatostatin | stomach, small intestine, and pancreas | inhibits release GI hormones; slows gastric emptying, Gi motility and blood flow to the intestine |

| Secretion | Sites of Production | Functions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Saliva | mouth | dissolves taste-forming compounds |
| Mucus | mouth, stomach, small and large intestine | protects GI tract cells, lubricates digesting food  |
| Enzymes (ie. amylase, lipase, protease)  | mouth, stomach, small intestine, pancreas | break down carbs, fats, and proteins into small forms for absorption |
| Acid (HCl)  | stomach | promotes digestion of protein, destroys microorganisms, increases solubility of minerals |
| Bile | liver (stored in gallbladder)  | aids in fat digestion (emulsifies fat)  |
| Bicarb | pancreas, small intestine | neutralizes stomach acid when it reaches small intestine |
| Hormones | stomach, small intestine, pancreas | regulate food intake, digestion and absorption  |

**Parasympathetic —** body at rest, regulates heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate etc. 
**Sympathetic —** stress; inhibits digestion
**Gut Brain Axis: Bidirectional Communication**

### GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease)
Reflux of stomach acid (HCl) due to loosening of lower esophageal sphincter.
Caused by hiatial hernia, alcohol use, overweight, smoking, medications, pregnancy, anxiety 

**Symptoms** 
- Usually none or pain, hoarseness, trouble swallowing, coughing, gagging, nausea
- More serious ; weight loss, ulceration/narrowing/bleeding of esophagus, cancer

**Treatment** 

- avoid large meals, fried/fatty foods, acidic foods, caffeine, chocolate
- don’t lie down 2 hours post meal
- elevate head of bed
- Medications
    - Antacids
    - H2 blockers —> block increase in stomach acid production caused by histamine
    - PPIs —> acid suppressing medications
    - Prokinetics —> strengthen LES and promote more rapid peristalsis

### Ulcers

Very small erosion of the top layer of cells in the stomach, caused by H. pylori and heavy use of NSAIDs 

### NAFLD (Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease)
Liver cells store excess fat —> liver swelling, inflammation 

**Symptoms** - fatigue, nausea, poor appetite, jaundice, pain under ribs
**Treatment** - lifestyle changes, weight loss, physical activity, avoid alcohol, sugar and eat a nutritious diet
### Gallstones
Substances in the bile (mainly cholesterol and bile pigments) —> slow gallbladder motility and bile composition
### Diarrhea
- Loose, watery stools >3x a day
- Usually only for a few days and then resolves
- Caused by bacterial or viral infection which cause intestinal tract to secrete fluid instead of absorbing it 

### Inflammatory Bowel Disease
- Immune mediated disorder (Chron’s disease and ulcerative colitis) 
- Inflammation and ulcerations of GI tract that causes scarring and narrowing of intestines 
- Complications are caused by nutritional deficiencies and inflammation
