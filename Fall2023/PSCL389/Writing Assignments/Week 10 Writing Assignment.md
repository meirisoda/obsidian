# Jamie Lee Week 10 Writing Assignment 
I want to take this week's writing assignments to talk about my goals. 

I've found these weeks readings to be extremely relevant to where I currently am in life. I am 2 semesters away from graduating from a program that is extremely strict and inflexible, nursing. I came into college unsure of what direction I wanted to go in life and I believed the nursing was a safe route that would ensure stability in the future. But as time would go on, my interests became clearer and clearer. 
I even very recently tweeted about this, I wrote: 
"It's frustrating knowing where you want to be and seeing where you are right now
and not knowing the exact path to get to where you want to be."
"What I want for myself has slowly become clearer over the course of the past couple years, but during those past couple years I am moving further away from that goal because of the path I am currently on. And I regret not using that time to move forward in my vision."
"It just feels like wasted time and I am constantly holding myself back."
"I am slowly rediscovering myself but it's just lost time and I know there is no point in looking back and regretting the things I haven't done - just look forward and see what I can do now but it's just a shame."

Which is extremely timely. I'm at a time in my life where I'm nearing graduation and my post-graduation plans will soon become a reality. But I don't even have a solid idea of what I want to do post graduation. I came to CWRU as a nursing student and I am still a nursing student. I was originally planning on going to art school for illustration, and throughout the portfolio process, I became extremely discouraged and switched over to nursing. I didn't think I could really achieve anything else. I didn't think that at the time, but now that I look back, the reason I didn't consider any other path for myself was becuase I didn't think that I was capable. 
And now I am nearing the end of my nursing school career. Throughout this time, I've gone through a lot. I've had a lot of mental health issues (still do!), took a year off from school, and gone through a lot of financial issues. And having gone through everything and still being in the program, you would think that I would be ever more grateful to be here. 

But I'm not.
While I value the education that I got here, I have always known that I had separate personal interests. I never saw myself as a nurse. I don't see myself being a nurse for the rest of my life. I still have very strong interests in art, and recently (in the past couple of years) developed a strong interest in programming, web developement and art. I am also now dating somebody who has equal strong interests as me in the same fields, but at a later stage in their skill level. And while seeing that and being around him I am motivated, I am also sad about where I am. There are so many classes that I would like to be able to take at Case, because we have really great professors and great resources that allow students to pursue interests further, I am locked into a program with no leeway. I have no room in my schedule to take classes that I would like to take. And with that comes my current perspective on my life's meaning. 
I think my life's meaning is on hold at the moment. I am somebody who is generally extremely positive, and was a good example of someone who would "exert less cognitive effort when making judgements and are subsequently more likely to use a simple 'feelings-as-information' heuristic compared to people in negative moods". The feeling is equal to my experience, which is equal to my life's meaning. However, since I'm not in a really good place at the moment, my feeling of negativity is also equating to my life's meaning right now. Thus, making my life not good. 

I also injured myself and am unable to really do anything for myself. Maybe this isn't a good time for me to write a paper on my goals. Because I'm not in a really good place physically (unable to move, unable to walk, unable to do all of the activities that made me happy but also the things that helped me survive, ie. money) and I am also not in a good place mentally (due to the physical injury, having unsure feelings about my future and what I want to do for myself, my mother) - I am not thinking properly. I don't think I'll be able to think properly for quite some time. 

The weather is also affecting how I view my happiness and the things that make me happy. 

Update: I am feeling a bit better but regarding my goals and the feeling of separation between me currently and my goals is quite depressing. I know that I am not necessarily thinking the clearest I can due to the change in weather. I've had a couple  days for clarity and reflection on what I have written. I just need to do what I need to do now. Positive or negative reminiscence isn't going to do much for me at the moment, and looking solely into the future and pre-determining my happiness based on my pre-determined idea of my future isn't going to do anything for me either. 
I just wish circumstances were different.
