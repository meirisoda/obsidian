Heavy reliance on javascript I guess. And other js frameworks, mainly:
p5js
3js
touchscript
react.js 
processing

interactions between the natural world and the digital world. Not making the digital world my natural world, but bringing in natural and organic-ness as much as possible into the digital world.
